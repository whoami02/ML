moment he allowed hi mself the impossible hope that nobody would answer him However a voice responded at once a crisp decisive voice that sounded as though it were reading a prepared statement It was coming as the Prime Minister had known at the first cough from th e froglike little man wearing a long silver wig who was depicted in a small dirty oil painting in the far corner of the room To the Prime Minister of Muggles Urgent we meet Kindly respond immediately Sincerely Fudge The man in the painting looked in quiringly at the Prime Minister Er said the Prime Minister l isten Its not a very good time for me Im waiting for a telephone call you see from the President of That can be rearranged said the portrait at once The Prime Ministers heart sank He had been afraid of that But I really was rather hoping to speak We shall arrange for the President to forget to call He will telephone tomorrow night instead said the little man Kindly respond immediately to Mr Fudge I oh very well said the Prime Minister weakly Yes Ill see Fudge He hurried back to his desk stra ightening his tie as he went He had barely resumed his seat and a rranged his face into what he hoped was a relaxed and unfazed expression when bright green flames burst into life in the em pty grate beneath his marble mantelpiece He watched trying not to betray a flicker of surprise or CHAPTER ONE 4 alarm as a portly man appeared wi thin the flames spinning as fast as a top Seconds later he had climbed out onto a rather fine antique rug brushing ash from the sleeves of his long pinstriped cloak a limegreen bo wler hat in his hand Ah Prime Minister said Cornelius Fudge striding forward with his hand outstretched Good to se e you again The Prime Minister could not honestly return this compliment so said nothing at all He was no t remotely pleased to see Fudge whose occasional appe arances apart from being downright alarming in themselves generally meant that he was about to hear some very bad news Furthermore Fudg e was looking distinctly careworn He was thinner balder and grayer and his face had a crumpled look The Prime Minister ha d seen that kind of look in politicians before and it never boded well How can I help you he said sh aking Fudges hand very briefly and gesturing toward the hardest of the chairs in front of the desk Difficult to know where to begi n muttered Fudge pulling up the chair sitting down and placing his green bowler upon his knees What a week what a week Had a bad one too have you as ked the Prime Minister stiffly hoping to convey by this that he had quite enough on his plate already without any extra helpings from Fudge Yes of course said Fudge ru bbing his eyes wearily and looking morosely at the Prime Minist er Ive been having the same week you have Prime Minister The Brockdale Bridge the Bones and Vance murders not to mention the ruckus in the West Country Y o u e r y o u r I m e a n t o s a y s o m e o f y o u r p e o p l e were were involved in thos e those things were they THE OTHER MINISTER 5 Fudge fixed the Prime Minister with a rather stern look Of course they were he said Surely youve realized whats going on I hesitated the Prime Minister It was precisely this sort of behavior that ma de him dislike Fudges visits so much He was after all the Prime Minister and did not appreciate being made to feel like an ignorant schoolboy But of course it had been like this from his very first meeting with Fudge on his very first evening as Prime Minister He remembered it as though it were yesterday and knew it would haunt him until his dying day He had been standing alone in th is very office savoring the triumph that was his after so many years of dreaming and scheming when he had heard a cough behind him just like tonight and turned to find that ugly little portrait talking to him announcing that the Minister of Magic wa s about to arrive an d introduce himself Naturally he had thought that th e long campaign and the strain of the election had caused him to go mad He had been utterly terrified to find a portrait talking to him though this had been nothing to how he felt when a selfp roclaimed wizard had bounced out of the fireplace and shaken his hand He had remained speechless throughout Fudges kind ly explanation that there were witches and wizards still living in secret all over the world and his reassurances that he was not to bother his head about them as the Ministry of Magic took responsibility for the whole Wizarding community and prevented the nonmagical populati on from getting wind of them It was said Fudge a difficult job that encompassed everything from regulations on responsible use of broomsticks to keeping the dragon population under cont rol the Prime Minister remembered clutching the desk for suppor t at this point Fudge had then CHAPTER ONE 6 patted the shoulder of the stilldumbstruck Prime Minister in a fatherly sort of way Not to worry he had said i ts oddson youll never see me again Ill only bother you if theres something really serious going on our end something thats likely to affect the Muggles the nonmagical population I should say Otherwise its live and let live And I must say youre taking it a lot better than your predecessor He tried to throw me out the window thought I was a hoax planned by the opposition At this the Prime Minister had found his voice at last Youre youre not a hoax then It had been his la st desperate hope No said Fudge gently No Im afraid Im not Look And he had turned the Prime Mini sters teacup into a gerbil But said the Prime Minister breathlessly watching his teacup chewing on the corner of his next speech but why why has nobody told me The Minister of Magic only reve als him or herself to the Muggle Prime Minister of the day sa id Fudge poking his wand back inside his jacket We find it th e best way to maintain secrecy But then bleated the Prime Mi nister why hasnt a former Prime Minister warned me At this Fudge had actually laughed My dear Prime Minister are you ever going to tell anybody Still chortling Fudge had thrown some powder into the fireplace stepped into the emerald flames and vanished with a whooshing sound The Prime Minister had sto od there quite motionless and realized that he would never as long as he lived dare mention this encounter to a living soul for who in the wide world would believe him THE OTHER MINISTER 7 The shock had taken a little while to wear off For a time he had tried to convince himself that Fudge had indeed been a hallucination brought on by lack of sleep during his grueling election campaign In a vain attempt to rid himself of all reminders of this uncomfortable encounter he had given the gerbil to his delighted niece and instructed his private se cretary to take down the portrait of the ugly little man who had a nnounced Fudges arrival To the Prime Ministers dismay however the portrait had proved impossible to remove When several carpent ers a builder or two an art historian and the Chancellor of the Exchequer had all tried unsuccessfully to prise it from the wa ll the Prime Minister had abandoned the attempt and simply reso lved to hope that the thing remained motionless and silent for the rest of his term in office Occasionally he could have sworn he saw out of the corner of his eye the occupant of the painting yawning or else scratching his nose even once or twice simply walking out of his frame and leaving nothing but a stretch of muddybrown canvas behind However he had trained himself not to look at the picture very much and always to tell himself firmly th at his eyes were playing tricks on him when anything like this happened Then three years ago on a nigh t very like tonight the Prime Minister had been alone in his o ffice when the po rtrait had once again announced the imminent arriva l of Fudge who had burst out of the fireplace sopping wet and in a state of considerable panic Before the Prime Minister could as k why he was dripping all over the Axminster Fudge had started ranting about a prison the Prime Minister had never heard of a man named Serious Black something that sounded like Hogwarts and a boy called Harry Potter none of which made the remotest sense to the Prime Minister CHAPTER ONE 8 Ive just come from Az kaban Fudge had panted tipping a large amount of water out of the rim of his bowler hat into his pocket Middle of the North Sea you know nasty flight the dementors are in uproar he shuddered theyve never had a breakout before Anyway I had to come to you Prime Minister Blacks a known Muggle killer and may be planning to rejoin YouKnowWho But of course you dont even know who YouKnowWho is He had gazed hopele ssly at the Prime Minister for a moment then said Well sit down sit down Id better fill you in Have a whiskey The Prime Minister rather resented being told to sit down in his own office let alone offered his own whiskey but he sat nevertheless Fudge pulled out his wand conj ured two large glasses full of amber liquid out of thin air pu shed one of them into the Prime Ministers hand and drew up a chair Fudge had talked for more than an hour At one point he had refused to say a certain name alou d and wrote it instead on a piece of parchment which he had thru st into the Prime Ministers whiskeyfree hand When at last Fudge had stood up to leave the Prime Minister ha d stood up too So you think that He had squinted down at the name in his left hand Lord Vol HeWhoMustNotBeNamed snarled Fudge Im sorry You think that HeWhoMustNotBeNamed is still alive then Well Dumbledore says he is said Fudge as he had fastened his pinstriped cloak under his ch in but weve never found him If you ask me hes not dangerous unless hes got support so its Black we ought to be worrying abou t Youll put out that warning THE OTHER MINISTER 9 then Excellent Well I hope we don t see each other again Prime Minister Good night But they had seen each other ag ain Less than a year later a harassedlooking Fudge had appeared out of thin air in the cabinet room to inform the Prime Minister that there had been a spot of bother at the Kwidditch or that was what it had sounded like World Cup and that several Muggle s had been involved but that the Prime Minister was not to worry the fact that YouKnowWhos Mark had been seen again me ant nothing Fudge was sure it was an isolated incide nt and the Muggle Liai son Office was dealing with all memory modifications as they spoke Oh and I almost forgot Fudg e had added Were importing three foreign dragons and a sphinx for the Triwizard Tournament quite routine but the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures tells me that its down in the rule book that we have to notify you if were br inging highly da ngerous creatures into the country I what dragons spluttered the Prime Minister Yes three said Fudge And a sphinx Well good day to you The Prime Minister had hoped beyond hope that dragons and sphinxes would be the worst of it but no Less than two years later Fudge had erupted out of the fire ye t again this time with the news that there had been a mass breakout from Azkaban A mass breakout repeated the Prime Minister hoarsely No need to worry no need to worry shouted Fudge already with one foot in the flames We ll have them rounded up in no time just thought you ought to know And before the Prime Minister co uld shout Now wait just one moment Fudge had vanished in a shower of green sparks CHAPTER ONE 10 Whatever the press and the opposition might say the Prime Minister was not a foolish man It ha d not escaped his notice that despite Fudges assurances at their fi rst meeting they were now seeing rather a lot of each other nor th at Fudge was becoming more flustered with each visit Little though he liked to think about the Minister of Magic or as he always called Fudge in his head the Other Minister the Prime Minister could not help but fear that the next time Fudge appeared it would be wi th graver news still The sight therefore of Fudge stepping out of the fire once more looking disheveled and fretful and sternly su rprised that the Prime Minister did not know exactly why he was there was about the worst thing that had happened in the course of this extremely gloomy week How should I know whats goin g on in the er Wizarding community snapped the Prime Minister now I have a country to run and quite enough concer ns at the moment without We have the same concerns Fudge interrupted The Brockdale Bridge didnt wear out That wasnt really a hurricane Those murders were not the work of Muggles And Herbert Chorleys family would be safer without him We are currently making arrangements to have him transferred to St Mungos Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries The move should be effected tonight What do you Im afraid I What blustered the Prime Minister Fudge took a great deep breath and said Prime Minister I am very sorry to have to tell you th at hes back HeWhoMustNotBeNamed is back Back When you say back hes alive I mean The Prime Minister groped in hi s memory for the details of that THE OTHER MINISTER 11 horrible conversation of three years previously when Fudge had told him about the wizard who was feared above all others the wizard who had committed a thousand terrible crimes before his mysterious disappearance fi fteen years earlier Yes alive said Fudge That is I dont know is a man alive if he cant be killed I dont really understand it and Dumbledore wont explain properly but anyway hes certainly got a body and is walking and talking an d killing so I suppose for the purposes of our discussi on yes hes alive The Prime Minister did not know what to say to this but a persistent habit of wishing to appe ar wellinformed on any subject t h a t c a m e u p m a d e h i m c a s t a r o u n d f o r a n y d e t a i l s h e c o u l d r e member of their previous conversations Is Serious Black with er HeWhoMustNotBeNamed Black Black said Fudge dist ractedly turning his bowler rapidly in his fingers Sirius Black you mean Merlins beard no Blacks dead Turns out we were er mistaken about Black He was innocent after all And he wasnt in league with HeWhoMustNotBeNamed either I mean he added defensively spinning the bowler hat still faster a ll the evidence pointed we had more than fifty eyewitnesses but anyway as I say hes dead Murdered as a matter of fact On Ministry of Magic premises Theres going to be an inquiry actually To his great surprise the Prime Minister felt a fleeting stab of pity for Fudge at this point It was however eclipsed almost immediately by a glow of smugness at the thought that deficient though he himself might be in the area of materializing out of fireplaces there had never been a murd er in any of the government departments under his charge Not yet anyway CHAPTER ONE 12 While the Prime Minister surrept itiously touched the wood of his desk Fudge continued But Blacks bytheby now The point is were at war Prime Minist er and steps must be taken At war repeated the Prime Mini ster nervously Surely thats a little bit of an overstatement HeWhoMustNotBeNamed has now been joined by those of his followers who broke out of Azkaban in January said Fudge speaking more and more rapidly and twirling his bowler so fast that it was a limegreen blur Since they have moved into the open they have been wreaking havoc Th e Brockdale Bridge he did it Prime Minister he threatened a mass Muggle killing unless I stood aside for him and Good grief so its your fault those people were killed and Im having to answer questions abou t rusted rigging and corroded expansion joints and I dont know wh at else said the Prime Minister furiously My fault said Fudge coloring up Are you saying you would have caved in to blackmail like that Maybe not said the Prime Mini ster standing up and striding about the room but I would have put all my efforts into catching the blackmailer before he co mmitted any such atrocity Do you really think I wasnt already making every effort demanded Fudge heatedly Every Au ror in the Ministry was and is trying to find him and roun d up his followers but we happen to be talking about one of the most powerful wizards of all time a wizard who has eluded captur e for almost three decades So I suppose youre going to tell me he caused the hurricane in the West Country too said the Prime Minister his temper rising with every pace he took It was in furiating to discover the reason THE OTHER MINISTER 13 for all these terrible disasters and no t to be able to tell the public almost worse than it being the governments fault after all That was no hurricane said Fudge miserably Excuse me barked the Prime Minister now positively stamping up and down Trees uprooted roofs ripped off lampposts bent horrible injuries It was the Death Eaters said Fudge HeWhoMustNotBeNameds followers An d and we suspec t giant involvement The Prime Minister stopped in hi s tracks as though he had hit an invisible wall What involvement Fudge grimaced He used giants last time when he wanted to go for the grand effect he said The Office of Misinformation has been working around the clock weve had teams of Obliviators out trying to modify the memori es of all the Muggles who saw what really happened weve got mo st of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures running around Somerset but we cant find the giant its been a disaster You dont say sa id the Prime Minister furiously I wont deny that morale is pr etty low at the Ministry said Fudge What with al l that and then losi ng Amelia Bones Losing who Amelia Bones Head of the De partment of Magical Law Enforcement We think HeWhoMustNotBeNamed may have murdered her in person because she was a very gifted witch and and all the evidence was that she put up a real fight Fudge cleared his throat and wi th an effort it seemed stopped spinning his bowler hat But that murder wa s in the newspapers said the Prime Minister momentarily diverted from his anger Our newspapers Amelia CHAPTER ONE 14 Bones it just said she wa s a middleaged woman who lived alone It was a a nasty killing wa snt it Its had rather a lot of publicity The police are baffled you see Fudge sighed Well of course th ey are he said Killed in a room that was locked from the insi de wasnt she We on the other hand know exactly who did it not that that gets us any further toward catching him And then there was Emmeline Vance maybe you didnt hear ab out that one Oh yes I did said the Prime Minister It happened just around the corner from here as a matter of fact The papers had a field day with it breakdown of law and order in the Prime Ministers backyard And as if all that wasnt enough said Fudge barely listening to the Prime Minister weve got de mentors swarming all over the place attacking people left right and center Once upon a happier time this sentence would have been unintelligible to the Prime Minister but he was wiser now I thought dementors guard the pr isoners in Azkaban he said cautiously They did said Fudge wearily But not anymore Theyve deserted the prison and joined HeWhoMustNotBeNamed I wont pretend that wasnt a blow But said the Prime Minister with a sense of dawning horror didnt you tell me theyre the cr eatures that drai n hope and happiness out of people Thats right And theyre breeding Thats whats causing all this mist The Prime Minister sank weakkneed into the nearest chair The idea of invisible creature s swooping through the towns and THE OTHER MINISTER 15 countryside spreading despair and hopelessness in his voters made him feel quite faint Now see here Fudge youve go t to do something Its your responsibility as Minister of Magic My dear Prime Minister you ca nt honestly think Im still Minister of Magic after all this I was sacked three days ago The whole Wizarding community has been scre aming for my resignation for a fortnight Ive never known them s o u n i t e d i n m y w h o l e t e r m o f office said Fudge with a brave attempt at a smile The Prime Minister was momentaril y lost for words Despite his indignation at the position into which he had been placed he still rather felt for the shrunkenloo king man sitting opposite him Im very sorry he said finally If theres anyt hing I can do Its very kind of you Prime Mini ster but there is nothing I was sent here tonight to bring you up to date on recent events and to introduce you to my successor I rather thought hed be here by now but of course hes very busy at th e moment with so much going on Fudge looked around at the portra it of the ugly little man wearing the long curly silver wig who was digging in his ear with the point of a quill Catching Fudges eye the portrait said Hell be here in a moment hes just fini shing a letter to Dumbledore I wish him luck said Fudge sounding bitter for the first time Ive been writing to Dumbledore twice a day for the past fortnight but he wont budge If hed just been prepared to persuade the boy I might still be Well maybe Scrimgeour will have more success Fudge subsided into what was clea rly an aggrieved silence but it was broken almost immediately by the portrait which suddenly spoke in its crisp official voice To the Prime Minister of Muggles Requesting a meeting CHAPTER ONE 16 Urgent Kindly respond immediatel y Rufus Scrimgeour Minister of Magic Yes yes fine said the Prime Minister distractedly and he barely flinched as the flames in the grate turned emerald green again rose up and revealed a se cond spinning wizard in their heart disgorging him moments later onto the antique rug Fudge got to his feet and after a moments hesitation the Prime Minister did the same watching th e new arrival straighten up dust down his long black robes and look around The Prime Ministers first foolish thought was that Rufus Scrimgeour looked rather like an old lion There were streaks of gray in his mane of tawny hair and his bushy eyebrows he had keen yellowish eyes behind a pair of wirerimmed spectacles and a certain rangy loping grace even th ough he walked with a slight limp There was an immediate impression of shrewdness and toughness the Prime Minister thought he understood why the Wizarding community preferred Scri mgeour to Fudge as a leader in these dangerous times How do you do said the Prime Minister politely holding out his hand Scrimgeour grasped it briefly his eyes scanning the room then pulled out a wand from under his robes Fudge told you everything he as ked striding over to the door and tapping the keyhole with his wand The Prime Minister heard the lock click Er yes said the Prime Minister And if you dont mind Id rather that door re mained unlocked Id rather not be interrupted said Scrimgeour shortly or watched he added pointing his wa nd at the windows so that the THE OTHER MINISTER 17 curtains swept across them Right well Im a busy man so lets get down to business First of all we need to discuss your security The Prime Minister drew himself up to his fullest height and replied I am perfectl y happy with the security Ive already got thank you very Well were not Scrimgeour cut in Itll be a poor lookout for the Muggles if their Prime Minister gets put under the Imperius Curse The new secretary in your outer office Im not getting rid of Kingsley Shacklebolt if thats what youre suggesting said the Prime Minister hotly Hes highly efficient gets through twice the work the rest of them Thats because hes a wizard sa id Scrimgeour without a flicker of a smile A highly trained Auro r who has been assigned to you for your protection Now wait a moment declared the Prime Minister You cant just put your people into my offi ce I decide who works for me I thought you were happy with Shacklebolt said Scrimgeour coldly I am thats to say I was Then theres no problem is there said Scrimgeour I well as long as Shacklebol ts work continues to be er excellent said the Prime Minister lamely but Scrimgeour barely seemed to hear him Now about Herbert Chorley your Junior Minister he continued The one who has been entertaining the public by impersonating a duck What about him aske d the Prime Minister He has clearly reacted to a poorly performed Imperi us Curse said Scrimgeour Its addled his brains but he could still be dangerous CHAPTER ONE 18 Hes only quacking said the Prime Minister weakly Surely a bit of a rest Maybe go easy on the drink A team of Healers from St Mungos Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries are examining him as we speak So far he has attempted to strangle three of them said Scrimgeour I think it best that we remove him from Muggle society for a while I well Hell be all right wont he said the Prime Minister anxiously Scrimgeour merely shrugged al ready moving back toward the fireplace Well thats really all I had to say I will keep you posted of developments Prime Minister or at least I shall probably be too busy to come personally in which case I shall send Fudge here He has consented to stay on in an advisory capacity Fudge attempted to smile bu t was unsuccessful he merely looked as though he had a tootha che Scrimgeour was already rummaging in his pocket for the myster ious powder that turned the fire green The Prime Minister gazed hope lessly at the pair of them for a moment then the words he had fought to suppress all evening burst from him at last But for heavens sake youre wizards You can do magic Surely you can sort out well anything Scrimgeour turned slowly on th e spot and exchanged an incredulous look with Fudge who really did manage a smile this time as he said kindly The trouble is the other side can do magic too Prime Minister And with that the two wizards stepped one after the other into the bright green fi re and vanished T W O 19 SPINNERS END any miles away the chilly mist that had pressed against the Prime Ministers windows drifted over a dirty river that wound between overgrow n rubbishstrewn banks An immense chimney relic of a disused mill reared up shadowy and ominous There was no sound apart from the whisper of the black water and no sign of life apart fr om a scrawny fox that had slunk down the bank to nose hopefully at some old fishandchip wrappings in the tall grass But then with a very faint pop a slim hooded figure appeared out of thin air on the edge of the river The fox froze wary eyes fixed upon this strange new phenomenon The figure seemed to take its bearings for a few moments then set off with light quick strides its long cloak ru stling over the grass With a second and louder pop another hooded figure materialized Wait M CHAPTER TWO 20 The harsh cry startled the fox now crouching almost flat in the undergrowth It leapt from its hid ing place and up the bank There was a flash of green light a yelp and the fox fell back to the ground dead The second figure turned over the animal with its toe Just a fox said a womans voic e dismissively from under the hood I thought perhaps an Auror Cissy wait But her quarry who had paused an d looked back at the flash of light was already scrambling up the bank the fox had just fallen down Cissy Narcissa listen to me The second woman caught the firs t and seized her arm but the other wrenched it away Go back Bella You must listen to me Ive listened already Ive made my decision Leave me alone The woman named Narcissa gained the top of the bank where a line of old railings separated the river from a narrow cobbled street The other woman Bella foll owed at once Side by side they stood looking across the road at th e rows and rows of dilapidated brick houses their wi ndows dull and blin d in the darkness He lives here asked Bella in a voice of contempt Here In this Muggle dunghill We must be the first of our kind ever to set foot But Narcissa was not listening sh e had slipped through a gap in the rusty railings and was al ready hurrying across the road Cissy wait Bella followed her cloak stream ing behind and saw Narcissa darting through an alley between th e houses into a second almost SPINNERS END 21 identical street Some of the st reetlamps were broken the two women were running between patches of light and deep darkness The pursuer caught up with her prey just as she turned another corner this time succeeding in ca tching hold of her arm and swinging her around so that they faced each other Cissy you must not do th is you cant trust him The Dark Lord trusts him doesnt he The Dark Lord is I believ e mistaken Bella panted and her eyes gleamed momentaril y under her hood as she looked around to check that they were in deed alone In any case we were told not to speak of the plan to anyone This is a betrayal of the Dark Lords Let go Bella snarled Narcissa and she drew a wand from beneath her cloak holding it threateningly in the others face Bella merely laughed Cissy your own sister You wouldnt There is nothing I wouldnt do anymore Narcissa breathed a note of hysteria in her voice and as she brought down the wand like a knife there was another flash of light Bella let go of her sisters arm as though burned Narcissa But Narcissa had rushed ahead Rubbing her hand her pursuer followed again keeping her distan ce now as they moved deeper into the deserted labyrinth of br ick houses At last Narcissa hurried up a street named Spinners En d over which the towering mill chimney seemed to hover like a giant admonitory finger Her footsteps echoed on the cobbles as she passed boarded and broken windows until she reached the very last house where a dim light glimmered through the curtai ns in a downstairs room CHAPTER TWO 22 She had knocked on the door befo re Bella cursing under her breath had caught up Together they stood waiting panting slightly breathing in the smell of the dirty river that was carried to them on the night breeze After a few seconds they heard movement behind the door and it opened a crack A sliver of a man could be seen looking out at them a man with long black hair parted in curtains around a sallow face and black eyes Narcissa threw back he r hood She was so pa le that she seemed to shine in the darkness the long blonde hair streaming down her back gave her the look of a drowned person Narcissa said the man opening the door a little wider so that the light fell upon her and her si ster too What a pleasant surprise Severus she said in a strained whisper May I speak to you Its urgent But of course He stood back to allow her to pass him into the house Her stillhooded sister followed without invitation Snape she said curtly as she passed him Bellatrix he replied his thin mouth curling into a slightly mocking smile as he closed the door with a sn ap behind them They had stepped directly into a tiny sitting room which had the feeling of a dark padded cell The walls were completely covered in books most of them bound in old black or brown leather a threadbare sofa an old armc hair and a rickety table stood grouped together in a pool of dim light cast by a candlefilled lamp hung from the ceiling The place ha d an air of neglect as though it was not usually inhabited Snape gestured Narcissa to the so fa She threw off her cloak cast SPINNERS END 23 it aside and sat down staring at her white and trembling hands clasped in her lap Bellatrix lowe red her hood more slowly Dark as her sister was fair with heavily lidd ed eyes and a strong jaw she did not take her gaze from Snape as she moved to stand behind Narcissa So what can I do for you Snape asked settling himself in the armchair opposite the two sisters We we are alone arent we Narcissa asked quietly Yes of course Well Wormtails here but were not counting vermin are we He pointed his wand at the wall of books behind him and with a bang a hidden door flew open revealing a narrow staircase upon which a small man stood frozen As you have clearly realized Wo rmtail we have guests said Snape lazily The man crept hunchbacked down the last few steps and moved into the room He had small watery eyes a pointed nose and wore an unpleasant simper His left hand was caressing his right which looked as though it was encased in a bright silver glove Narcissa he said in a sque aky voice And Bellatrix How charming Wormtail will get us drinks if youd like them said Snape And then he will return to his bedroom Wormtail winced as though Sn ape had thrown something at him I am not your servant he sq ueaked avoiding Snapes eye Really I was under the impression that the Dark Lord placed you here to assist me CHAPTER TWO 24 To assist yes but not to ma ke you drinks and and clean your house I had no idea Wormtail that you were craving more dangerous assignments said Snape silkily This can be easily arranged I shall speak to the Dark Lord I can speak to him my self if I want to Of course you can said Snape sneering But in the meantime bring us drinks Some of the elfmade wine will do Wormtail hesitated for a moment looking as though he might argue but then turned and head ed through a se cond hidden door They heard banging and a clinking of glasses Within seconds he was back bearing a dusty bottle an d three glasses upon a tray He dropped these on the rickety tabl e and scurried from their presence slamming the bookc overed door behind him Snape poured out thre e glasses of bloodred wine and handed two of them to the sisters Narc i s s a m u r m u r e d a w o r d o f t h a n k s whilst Bellatrix said nothing but continued to glower at Snape This did not seem to discompose him on the contrary he looked rather amused The Dark Lord he said rais ing his glass an d draining it The sisters copied him Snape refilled their glasses As Narcissa took her second drink she said in a rush Severus Im sorry to come here like this but I had to see you I think you are the only one who can help me Snape held up a hand to stop he r then pointed his wand again at the concealed stairc ase door There was a loud bang and a squeal followed by the sound of Wormtail scurrying back up the stairs My apologies said Snape He has lately taken to listening at SPINNERS END 25 doors I dont know what he mean s by it You were saying Narcissa She took a great shuddering breath and started again Severus I know I ought not to be here I have been told to say nothing to anyone but Then you ought to hold your tongue snarled Bellatrix Particularly in present company Present company repeated Snape sardonically And what am I to understand by that Bellatrix That I dont trust you Snape as you very well know Narcissa let out a noise that mi ght have been a dry sob and covered her face with her hands Snape set his glass down upon the table and sat back again his hands upon the arms of his chair smiling into Bellatrixs glowering face Narcissa I think we ought to hear what Bellatrix is bursting to say it will save tedious interru ptions Well continue Bellatrix said Snape Why is it that you do not trust me A hundred reasons she said lo udly striding out from behind the sofa to slam her glass upon th e table Where to start Where were you when the Dark Lord fell Why did you never make any attempt to find him when he vanished What have you been doing all these years that youve live d in Dumbledores pocket Why did you stop the Dark Lord procur ing the Sorcerers Stone Why did you not return at once when the Dark Lord was reborn Where were you a few weeks ago when we battled to retrieve the prophecy for the Dark Lord And why Snape is Harry Potter still alive when you have had him at yo ur mercy for five years She paused her chest risi ng and falling rapidly the color high in CHAPTER TWO 26 her cheeks Behind her Narcissa sat motionless her face still hidden in her hands Snape smiled Before I answer you oh yes Be llatrix I am going to answer You can carry my words back to the others who whisper behind my back and carry false tales of my tr eachery to the Dark Lord Before I answer you I say let me ask a question in turn Do you really think that the Dark Lord has not asked me each and every one of those questions And do you really think that had I not been able to give satisfactory answers I woul d be sitting here talking to you She hesitated I know he believes you but You think he is mistaken Or that I have somehow hoodwinked him Fooled the Dark Lord the greatest wizard the most accomplished Legilimens the world has ever seen Bellatrix said nothing but looked for the first time a little discomfited Snape did not press the point He picked up his drink again sipped it and continued You ask where I was when the Dark Lord fell I was where he ha d ordered me to be at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry because he wished me to spy upon Albus Dumbledore You know I presume that it was on the Dark Lords orders that I took up the post She nodded almost imperceptibl y and then opened her mouth but Snape forestalled her You ask why I did not attempt to find him when he vanished For the same reason that Avery Yaxley the Carrows Greyback Lucius he inclined his head slig h t l y t o N a r c i s s a a n d m a n y others did not attempt to find hi m I believed him finished I am not proud of it I was wrong but there it is If he had not SPINNERS END 27 forgiven we who lost faith at that time he would have very few followers left Hed have me said Bellatrix passionately I who spent many years in Azkaban for him Yes indeed most admirable sa id Snape in a bored voice Of course you werent a lot of use to him in prison but the gesture was undoubtedly fine Gesture she shrieked in her fury she looked slightly mad While I endured the dementors you remained at Hogwarts comfortably playing Dumbledores pet Not quite said Snape calmly He wouldnt give me the Defense Against the Dark Arts job you know Seemed to think it might ah bring about a relapse tempt me into my old ways This was your sacrifice for the Dark Lord not to teach your favorite subject she jeered Why did you stay there all that time S n a p e S t i l l s p y i n g o n D u m b l e dore for a master you believed dead Hardly said Snape although the Dark Lord is pleased that I never deserted my post I had sixteen years of information on Dumbledore to give him when he returned a rather more useful welcomeback present than endles s reminiscences of how unpleasant Azkaban is But you stayed Yes Bellatrix I stayed said Snape betraying a hint of impatience for the first time I had a comfortable job that I preferred to a stint in Azkaban They were rounding up the Death Eaters you know Dumbledores protection kept me out of jail it was most convenient and I used it I repe at The Dark Lord does not complain that I stayed so I do not see why you do CHAPTER TWO 28 I think you next wanted to know he pressed on a little more loudly for Bellatrix showed ever y sign of interr upting why I stood between the Dark Lord and the Sorcerers Stone That is easily answered He did not know whether he could trust me He thought like you that I had turned from faithful Death Eater to Dumbledores stooge He was in a pitiable condition very weak sharing the body of a mediocre wi zard He did not dare reveal himself to a former ally if that ally might turn him over to Dumbledore or the Ministry I deeply regret th at he did not trust me He would have returned to power three year s sooner As it was I saw only greedy and unworthy Quirrell attempting to steal the stone and I admit I did all I could to thwart him Bellatrixs mouth twisted as thou gh she had taken an unpleasant dose of medicine But you didnt return when he ca me back you didnt fly back to him at once when you felt the Dark Mark burn Correct I returned two hours later I returned on Dumbledores orders On Dumbledores she be gan in tones of outrage Think said Snape impatient again Think By waiting two hours just two hours I ensured that I could remain at Hogwarts as a spy By allowing Dumbledore to think that I was only returning to the Dark Lords side because I was ordered to I have been able to pass information on Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix ever since Consider Bellatrix The Dark Mark ha d been growing stronger for months I knew he must be about to return all the Death Eaters knew I had plenty of time to think about what I wanted to do to plan my next move to es cape like Karkaroff didnt I The Dark Lords initial disple asure at my lateness vanished SPINNERS END 29 entirely I assure you when I explai ned that I remained faithful although Dumbledore thought I was his man Yes the Dark Lord thought that I had left him forever but he was wrong But what use have you been sneered Bellatrix What useful information have we had from you My information has been conveyed directly to the Dark Lord said Snape If he chooses no t to share it with you He shares everything with me said Bellatrix firi ng up at once He calls me his most loya l his most faithful Does he said Snape his voice delicately inflected to suggest his disbelief Does he still after the fiasco at the Ministry That was not my fault said Be llatrix flushing The Dark Lord has in the past entrusted me with his most precious if Lucius hadnt Dont you dare dont you dare blame my husband said Narcissa in a low and deadly vo ice looking up at her sister There is no point apportioning blame said Snape smoothly What is done is done But not by you said Bellatrix furiously No you were once again absent while the re st of us ran dangers were you not Snape My orders were to remain behi nd said Snape Perhaps you disagree with the Dark Lord pe rhaps you think that Dumbledore would not have noticed if I had joi ned forces with the Death Eaters to fight the Order of the Phoeni x And forgive me you speak of dangers you were facing six teenagers were you not They were joined as you very well know by half of the Order before long snarled Bellatrix And while we are on the subject of the Order you still claim you cannot reveal the whereabouts of their headquar ters dont you CHAPTER TWO 30 I am not the SecretKeeper I cannot speak the name of the place You understand how the en chantment works I think The Dark Lord is satisfied with the information I have passed him on the Order It led as perhaps you have guessed to the recent capture and murder of Emmeline Vance and it certainly helped dispose of Sirius Black though I give you full credit for finishing him off He inclined his head and toasted her Her expression did not soften You are avoiding my last qu estion Snape Harry Potter You could have killed him at any point in the past five years You have not done it Why Have you discussed this matter with the Dark Lord asked Snape He lately we I am asking you Snape If I had murdered Harry Potter the Dark Lord could not have used his blood to regenerate making him invincible You claim you foresaw his us e of the boy she jeered I do not claim it I had no idea of his plans I have already confessed that I thought the Dark Lord dead I am merely trying to explain why the Dark Lord is not so rry that Potter survived at least until a year ago But why did you keep him alive Have you not understood me It was only Dumbledores protection that was keepin g me out of Azkaban Do you disagree that murdering his favorite student mi ght have turned him against me But there was more to it than that I should remind you that when Potter first arrived at Hogwarts th ere were still many stories circulating about him rumors that he himself was a great Dark wizard which was how he had survived th e Dark Lords attack Indeed SPINNERS END 31 many of the Dark Lords old foll owers thought Potter might be a standard around which we could a ll rally once more I was curious I admit it and not at all inclined to murder him th e moment he set foot in the castle Of course it became apparent to me very quickly that he had no extraordinary talent at all He has fought his way out of a number of tight corners by a simple combination of sheer luck and more talented friends He is medioc re to the last degree though as obnoxious and selfsatisfied as wa s his father before him I have done my utmost to have him thrown out of Hogwarts where I believe he scarcely belongs but kill him or allow him to be killed in front of me I would have been a f ool to risk it with Dumbledore close at hand And through all this we are supposed to believe Dumbledore has never suspected you asked Bellatrix He has no idea of your true allegiance he trusts you implicitly still I h a v e p l a y e d m y p a r t w e l l s a i d S n a p e A n d y o u o v e r l o o k Dumbledores greatest weakness He has to believe the best of people I spun him a tale of deepes t remorse when I joined his staff fresh from my Death Eater days and he embraced me with open arms though as I say never al lowing me nearer the Dark Arts than he could help Dumbledore ha s been a great wizard oh yes he has for Bellatrix had made a scathing noise the Dark Lord acknowledges it I am pleased to say however that Dumbledore is growing old The duel with the Dark Lord last month shook him He has since sustained a serious injury because his reactions are slower than they once were But through all these years he has never stopped trusting Severus Snape and therein lies my great value to the Dark Lord CHAPTER TWO 32 Bellatrix still looked unhappy though she appeared unsure how best to attack Snape next Taking advantage of her silence Snape turned to her sister Now you came to as k me for help Narcissa Narcissa looked up at him he r face eloquent with despair Yes Severus I I think you are the only one who can help me I have nowhere else to turn Lucius is in ja il and She closed her eyes and two larg e tears seeped from beneath her eyelids The Dark Lord has forbidden me to speak of it Narcissa continued her eyes still closed He wi shes none to know of the plan It is very secret But If he has forbidden it you ought not to speak said Snape at once The Dark Lords word is law Narcissa gasped as though he had doused her with cold water Bellatrix looked satisfied for the fi rst time since she had entered the house There she said triumphantly to her sister Even Snape says so You were told not to ta lk so hold your silence But Snape had gotten to his feet an d strode to the small window peered through the curtains at the deserted street then closed them again with a jerk He turned around to face Narcissa frowning It so happens that I know of the plan he said in a low voice I am one of the few the Dark Lord has told Nevertheless had I not been in on the secret Narcissa you would have been guilty of great treachery to the Dark Lord I thought you must know about it said Narcissa breathing more freely He trusts you so Severus SPINNERS END 33 You know about the plan said Bellatrix her fleeting expression of satisfaction replaced by a look of outrage You know Certainly said Snape But what help do you require Narcissa If you are imagining I can pe rsuade the Dark Lord to change his mind I am afraid there is no hope none at all Severus she whispered tears sliding down her pale cheeks My son my only son Draco should be proud said Be llatrix indifferently The Dark Lord is granting him a great honor And I will say this for Draco He isnt shrinking away from his duty he seems glad of a chance to prove himself excited at the prospect Narcissa began to cry in earnest gazing beseechingly all the while at Snape Thats because he is sixteen and ha s no idea what lies in store Why Severus Why my son It is too dangerous This is vengeance for Luciuss mistak e I know it Snape said nothing He looked aw ay from the sight of her tears as though they were indecent but he could not pretend not to hear her Thats why hes chosen Draco isnt it she persisted To punish Lucius If Draco succeeds said Snape st ill looking away from her he will be honored ab ove all others But he wont succeed sobbed Narcissa How can he when the Dark Lord himself Bellatrix gasped Narcissa seemed to lose her nerve I only meant that nobody has yet succeeded Severus please You are you have always been Dracos favorite CHAPTER TWO 34 teacher You are Luciuss old fr iend I beg you You are the Dark Lords favorite his most trusted advisor Will you speak to him persuade him The Dark Lord will not be pe rsuaded and I am not stupid enough to attempt it said Snape fl atly I cannot pretend that the Dark Lord is not angry with Lucius Lucius was supposed to be in charge He got himself captured along with how many others and failed to retrieve the prophecy into the bargain Yes the Dark Lord is angry Narcissa very angry indeed Then I am right he has chos en Draco in revenge choked Narcissa He does not mean him to succeed he wants him to be killed trying When Snape said nothing Narcissa seemed to lose what little selfrestraint she still possessed St anding up she staggered to Snape and seized the front of his robes Her face close to his her tears falling onto his chest sh e gasped You could do it You could do it instead of Draco Severus You wo uld succeed of course you would and he would reward you beyond all of us Snape caught hold of her wrists and removed her clutching hands Looking down into her tearstained face he said slowly He intends me to do it in the end I think But he is determined that Draco should try first You see in the unlikely event that Draco succeeds I shall be able to remain at Hogwarts a little longer fulfilling my useful role as spy In other words it doe snt matter to him if Draco is killed The Dark Lord is very angry repeated Snape quietly He failed to hear the prophecy You kn ow as well as I do Narcissa that he does not forgive easily SPINNERS END 35 She crumpled falling at his fe et sobbing and moaning on the floor My only son my only son You should be proud said Bellatrix ruthlessly If I had sons I would be glad to give them up to the service of the Dark Lord Narcissa gave a little scream of despair and clutched at her long blonde hair Snape stooped seized her by the arms lifted her up and steered her back onto the so fa He then poured her more wine and forced the gla ss into her hand Narcissa thats enough Dr ink this Listen to me She quieted a little slopping wine down herself she took a shaky sip It might be possible for me to help Draco She sat up her face pape rwhite her eyes huge Severus oh Severus you would help him Would you look after him see he comes to no harm I can try She flung away her glass it skidded across the table as she slid off the sofa into a kneeling position at Snapes feet seized his hand in both of hers and pres sed her lips to it If you are there to protect him Severus will you swear it Will you make the Unbreakable Vow The Unbreakable Vow Snapes expression was blank unre adable Bellatrix however let out a cackle of tr iumphant laughter Arent you listening Narcissa Oh hell try Im sure The usual empty words the usual slithering out of action oh on the Dark Lords orders of course CHAPTER TWO 36 Snape did not look at Bellatrix His black eyes were fixed upon Narcissas tearfilled bl ue ones as she continue d to clutch his hand Certainly Narcissa I shall make the Unbreakable Vow he said quietly Perhaps your sister wi ll consent to be our Bonder Bellatrixs mouth fell open Snape lowered himself so that he was kneeling opposite Narci ssa Beneath Bellatrixs astonished gaze they grasped right hands You will need your wand Be llatrix said Snape coldly She drew it still looking astonished And you will need to move a little closer he said She stepped forward so that she stood over them and placed the tip of her wand on their linked hands Narcissa spoke Will you Severus watch over my son Draco as he attempts to fulfill the Dark Lords wishes I will said Snape A thin tongue of brilliant flame issued from the wand and wound its way around their hands like a redhot wire And will you to the best of your ability protect him from harm I will said Snape A second tongue of flame shot from the wand and interlinked with the first making a fine glowing chain And should it prove necessar y if it seems Draco will fail whispe red Narcissa Snapes hand twitched within hers but he did not draw away wi ll you carry out the deed that the Dark Lord has ordered Draco to perform There was a moments silence Be llatrix watched her wand upon their clasped hands her eyes wide SPINNERS END 37 I will said Snape Bellatrixs astounded face glowed red in the blaze of a third tongue of flame which shot from the wand twisted with the others and bound itself thickly around their cl asped hands like a rope like a fiery snake T H R E E 38 WILL AND WONT arry Potter was snoring loudly He had been

that the disturbance centered on the fabled Hall of Prophecy Though Ministry spokes wizards have hitherto refused even to confirm the existence of such a place a growing number of the Wizarding community believe that the Death Eaters now serving sentences in Azkaban for tr espass and attempted theft were attempting to steal a prophecy The nature of that prophecy is unknown although speculation is rife that it concerns Harry Potter the only person ever known to have survived the Killing Curse and who is also known to have been at the Ministry on the night in question Some are going so far as to call Potter the Chosen One believing that the prophecy names him as the only one who will be able to rid us of HeWhoMustNotBeNamed The current whereabouts of the prophecy if it

today of the tough new measures taken by his Ministry to ensure the safety of students returning to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this autumn For obvious reasons the Ministry will not be

Inside it was a magnificent snowy owl Her amber eyes surveyed the room imperiously her head swiveling occasionally to gaze at her sn oring master Once or twice she clicked her beak impatiently but Harry was too deeply asleep to hear her A large trunk stood in the very mi ddle of the room Its lid was open it looked expectant yet it was almost empty but for a residue of old underwear sweets empty

face slid down the window an inch or so making his glasses still more lopsided but he did not wake up An alarm cl ock repaired by Ha rry several years ago ticked loudly on the sill showing one minute to eleven Beside it h e l d i n p l a c e b y H a r r y s r e l a x e d hand was a piece of parchment covered in thin slanting writing Harry had read this letter so often since its arrival three days ago that although it had been delivered in a tightly furled scroll it now lay quite flat Dear Harry If it is convenient to you I shall call at number four Privet Drive this coming Friday at eleven PM to escort you to the Burrow where you have been in vited to spend the remainder of your school holidays If you are agreeable I should al so be glad of your assistance in a matter to which I hope to attend on the way to the Burrow I shall explain this more fully when I see you Kindly send your answer by return of this owl Hoping to see you this Friday I am yours most sincerely Albus Dumbledore CHAPTER THREE 44 Though he already knew it by heart Harry had been stealing glances at this missive every few minutes since seven oclock that evening when he had first taken up his posi tion beside his bedroom window which had a reasonable view of both ends of Privet Drive He knew it was pointle ss to keep rereading Dumbledores words Harry had sent back his yes with the delivering owl as requested and all he could do now was wait Either Dumbledore was going to come or he was not But Harry had not packed It just seemed too good to be true that he was going to be rescued fr om the Dursleys af ter a mere fortnight of their company He coul d not shrug off the feeling that something was going to go wrong his reply to Dumbledores letter might have gone astray Dumbledore could be prevented from collecting him the letter might turn out not to be from Dumbledore at all but a trick or joke or trap Harry had not been able to face packing and then being let down and having to unpack again The only gesture he had made to th e possibility of a journey was to shut his snowy owl Hedw ig safely in her cage The minute hand on the alarm cl ock reached the number twelve and at that precise moment th e streetlamp outside the window went out Harry awoke as though the sudd en darkness were an alarm Hastily straightening hi s glasses and unsticking his cheek from the glass he pressed his nose agains t the window inst ead and squinted down at the pavement A tall figure in a long billowing cloak was walking up the garden path Harry jumped up as though he ha d received an electric shock knocked over his chair and started snatching anything and every WILL AND WONT 45 thing within reach from the floor and throwing it into the trunk Even as he lobbed a set of robes two spellbooks and a packet of crisps across the room the doorbell rang Downstairs in the living room his Uncle Vernon shouted Who the blazes is calling at this time of night Harry froze with a brass telescop e in one hand and a pair of trainers in the other He had co mpletely forgotten to warn the Dursleys that Dumbledore might be coming Feeling both panicky and close to laughter he clambe red over the trunk and wrenched open his bedroom door in time to hear a deep voice say Good evening You must be Mr Dursley I daresay Harry has told you I would be coming for him Harry ran down the stairs two at a time coming to an abrupt halt several steps from the bottom as long experience had taught him to remain out of arms reach of his uncle whenever possible There in the doorway stood a tall t hin man with wa istlength silver hair and beard Halfmoon sp ectacles were perched on his crooked nose and he was wearing a long black traveling cloak and a pointed hat Vernon Dursley wh ose mustache was quite as bushy as Dumbledores though black and who was wearing a puce dressing gown was staring at the visito r as though he could not believe his tiny eyes Judging by your look of stunned disbelief Harry did not warn you that I was coming said Du mbledore pleasantly However let us assume that you have invited me warmly into your house It is unwise to linger overlong on doo rsteps in these troubled times He stepped smartly over the thre shold and closed the front door behind him CHAPTER THREE 46 It is a long time since my last visit said Dumbledore peering down his crooked nose at Uncle Vernon I must say your agapanthus are flourishing Vernon Dursley said nothing at all Harry did not doubt that speech would return to him and soon the vein pulsing in his uncles temple was reaching danger point but something about Dumbledore seemed to have robbed him temporarily of breath It might have been the blatant wizard ishness of his appearance but it might too have been that even Uncle Vernon could sense that here was a man whom it would be very difficul t to bully Ah good evening Harry said Dumbledore looking up at him through his halfmoon glasses with a most satisfied expression Excellent excellent These words seemed to rouse Uncle Vernon It was clear that as far as he was concerned any man who could look at Harry and say excellent was a man with whom he could never see eye to eye I dont mean to be rude he began in a tone that threatened rudeness in every syllable yet sadly accidental rud eness occurs alarmingly often Dumbledore finished the sentence gr avely Best to say nothing at all my dear man Ah an d this must be Petunia The kitchen door had opened and there stood Harrys aunt wearing rubber gloves and a housecoat over her nightdress clearly halfway through her usual prebedtime wipedown of all the kitchen surfaces Her rather horsey face registered nothing but shock Albus Dumbledore said Dumbledore when Uncle Vernon failed to effect an introduction We have corresponded of course Harry thought this an odd way of re minding Aunt Petunia that he WILL AND WONT 47 had once sent her an exploding letter but Aunt Petunia did not challenge the term And this must be your son Dudley Dudley had that moment peered round the living room door His large blond head rising out of the stripy collar of his pajamas looked oddly disembodied his mout h gaping in astonishment and fear Dumbledore waited a moment or two apparently to see whether any of the Dursleys were going to say anything but as the silence stretched on he smiled Shall we assume that you have invited me into your sitting room Dudley scrambled out of the way as Dumbledore passed him Harry still clutching the telescope and traine rs jumped the last few stairs and followed Dumbledo re who had sett led himself in the armchair nearest the fire and was taking in the surroundings with an expression of benign interest He looked quite extraordinarily out of place Arent arent we leaving sir Harry asked anxiously Yes indeed we are but there are a few matters we need to discuss first said Dumbledore And I would prefer not to do so in the open We shall trespass upon yo ur aunt and uncles hospitality only a little longer You will will you Vernon Dursley had entered the room Petunia at his shoulder and Dudley skulking behind them both Yes said Dumbledor e simply I shall He drew his wand so rapidly that Harry barely saw it with a casual flick the sofa zoomed fo rward and knocke d the knees out from under all three of the Dursleys so that they collapsed upon it CHAPTER THREE 48 in a heap Another flick of the wa nd and the sofa zoomed back to its original position We may as well be comfortable said Dumbledore pleasantly As he replaced his wand in his pocket Harry saw that his hand was blackened and shriveled it look ed as though his flesh had been burned away Sir what happened to your Later Harry said Dumbledore Please sit down Harry took the remaining armchair choosing not to look at the Dursleys who seemed stunned into silence I would assume that you were going to offer me refreshment Dumbledore said to Uncle Vernon but the evidence so far suggests that that would be optimist ic to the point of foolishness A third twitch of the wand and a dusty bottle and five glasses appeared in midair The bottle ti pped and poured a generous measure of honeycolored liquid into each of the glasses which then floated to each person in the room Madam Rosmertas finest oak matured mead said Dumbledore raising his glass to Harry who caught hold of his own and sipped He had never tasted anythi ng like it before but enjoyed it immensely The Dursleys after quick scared looks at one another tried to ignore their glasse s completely a difficult feat as they were nudging them gently on the sides of their heads Harry could not suppress a suspicion that Dumbledore was rather enjoying himself Well Harry said Dumbledore turning toward him a difficulty has arisen which I hope you wi ll be able to solve for us By us I mean the Order of the Phoenix But first of all I must tell you that WILL AND WONT 49 Siriuss will was discovered a week ago and that he left you everything he owned Over on the sofa Uncle Vernons head turned but Harry did not look at him nor could he think of anything to say except Oh Right This is in the main fairly st raightforward Dumbledore went on You add a reasonable amount of gold to your account at Gringotts and you inherit all of Siriuss personal possessions The slightly problematic pa rt of the legacy His godfathers dead said Uncle Vernon loudly from the sofa Dumbledore and Harry both turned to look at him The glass of mead was now knocking quite insistently on th e side of Vernons head he attempted to beat it away Hes dead His godfather Yes said Dumbledore He did not ask Harry why he had not confided in the Dursleys Our pr oblem he continued to Harry as if there had been no interruption i s t h a t S i r i u s a l s o l e f t y o u number twelve Grimmauld Place Hes been left a house said Uncle Vernon greedily his small eyes narrowing but nobody answered him You can keep using it as head quarters said Harry I dont care You can have it I dont really want it Harry never wanted to set foot in number twelve Grimma uld Place again if he could help it He thought he would be haunted forever by the memory of Sirius prowling its dark musty rooms alone imprisoned within the place he had wanted so desperately to leave That is generous said Dumbledore We have however vacated the building temporarily Why CHAPTER THREE 50 Well said Dumbledore igno ring the mutterings of Uncle Vernon who was now being rapped smartly over the head by the persistent glass of mead Black family tradition decreed that the house was handed down the direct line to the next male with the name of Black Sirius was the very last of the line as his younger brother Regulus predeceased him and both were childless While his will makes it perfectly plain that he wants you to have the house it is nevertheless possible that so me spell or enchantment has been set upon the place to ensure that it cannot be owned by anyone other than a pureblood A vivid image of the sh rieking spitting po rtrait of Siriuss mother that hung in the hall of number twelve Grimmauld Place flashed into Harrys mind I bet there has he said Quite said Dumbledore And if such an enchantment exists then the ownership of the house is most likely to pass to the eldest of Siriuss living relatives whic h would mean his cousin Bellatrix Lestrange Without realizing what he was doing Harry sprang to his feet the telescope and trainers in his la p rolled across the floor Bellatrix Lestrange Siriuss kille r inherit his house No he said Well obviously we would prefer that she didnt get it either said Dumbledore calmly The situation is fraught with complications We do not know whether the enchantments we ourselves have placed upon it for example making it Unplottable will hold now that ownership has passed from Si riuss hands It might be that Bellatrix will arrive on the doorst ep at any moment Naturally we had to move out until such time as we have clarified the position But how are you going to find out if Im allowe d to own it WILL AND WONT 51 Fortunately said Dumbledore there is a simple test He placed his empty glass on a sm all table beside his chair but before he could do anything el se Uncle Vernon shouted Will you get these ruddy things off us Harry looked around all three of the Dursleys were cowering with their arms over their heads as their glasses bounced up and down on their skulls their contents flying everywhere Oh Im so sorry said Dumbledo re politely and he raised his wand again All three glasses va nished But it would have been better manners to drink it you know It looked as though Uncle Vernon was bursting with any number of unpleasant retorts but he merely shrank back into the cushions with Aunt Petunia and Dudley and said nothing keeping his small piggy eyes on Dumbledores wand You see Dumbledore said turn ing back to Harry and again speaking as though Uncle Vernon had not uttered if you have indeed inherited the house you have also inherited He flicked his wand for a fifth time There was a loud crack and a houseelf appeared with a snout for a nose giant bats ears and enormous bloodshot eyes crouching on the Dursleys shag carpet and covered in grimy rags Aunt Petunia let out a hairraising shriek nothing this filthy had ent ered her house in living memory Dudley drew his large bare pink feet off the floor and sat with them raised almost above his head as though he thought the creature might run up his pajama trousers and Uncle Vernon bellowed What the hell is that Kreacher finished Dumbledore Kreacher wont Kreacher wont Kreacher wont croaked the houseelf quite as loudly as Uncle Vernon stamping his long CHAPTER THREE 52 gnarled feet and pulling his ears Kreacher belongs to Miss Bellatrix oh yes Kreacher belongs to the Blacks Kreacher wants his new mistress Kreacher wont go to the Potter brat Kreacher wont wont wont As you can see Harry said Du mbledore loudly over Kreachers continued croaks of wont wont wont Kreacher is showing a certain reluctance to pass into your ownership I dont care said Harry again looking with disgust at the writhing stamping houseelf I dont want him W o n t w o n t w o n t w o n t You would prefer him to pass into the ownership of Bellatrix Lestrange Bearing in mind that he has lived at the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix for the past year W o n t w o n t w o n t w o n t Harry stared at Dumbledore He knew that Kreacher could not be permitted to go and live with Bellatrix Lestrange but the idea of owning him of having responsibili ty for the creature that had betrayed Sirius was repugnant Give him an order said Dumbledore If he has passed into your ownership he will have to obey If not then we shall have to think of some other means of keeping him from his rightful mistress W o n t w o n t w o n t W O N T Kreachers voice had risen to a scream Harry could think of nothing to say except Kreacher shut up It looked for a moment as though Kreacher was going to choke He grabbed his throat his mouth still working furiously his eyes bulging After a few seconds of frantic gulping he threw himself face forward onto the carpet A unt Petunia whimpered and beat WILL AND WONT 53 the floor with his hands and feet gi ving himself over to a violent but entirely silent tantrum Well that simplifies matters said Dumbledore cheerfully It seems that Sirius knew what he was doing You are the rightful owner of number twelve Grimma uld Place and of Kreacher Do I do I have to keep him with me Harry asked aghast as Kreacher thrashed around at his feet Not if you dont want to said Dumbledore If I might make a s u g g e s t i o n y o u c o u l d s e n d h i m t o H o g w a r t s t o w o r k i n t h e kitchen there In that way the ot her houseelves could keep an eye on him Yeah said Harry in relief yeah Ill do that Er Kreacher I want you to go to Hogwarts and work in the kitchens there with the other houseelves Kreacher who was now lying flat on his back with his arms and legs in the air gave Harry on e upsidedown look of deepest loathing and with anothe r loud crack vanished Good said Dumbledore There is also the matter of the hippogriff Buckbeak Hagrid has be en looking after him since Sirius died but Buckbeak is yours now so if you would prefer to make different arrangements No said Harry at once he can stay with Hagrid I think Buckbeak would prefer that Hagrid will be delighted said Dumbledore smiling He was thrilled to see Buckbeak again Incidentally we have decided in the interests of Buckbeaks safety to rechristen him Witherwings for the time being though I doubt that the Ministry would ever guess he is the hippogriff they once sentenced to death Now Harry is your trunk packed CHAPTER THREE 54 Erm Doubtful that I would turn up Dumbledore suggested shrewdly Ill just go and er finish off said Harry hastily hurrying to pick up his fallen telescope and trainers It took him a little over ten mi nutes to track dow n everything he needed at last he had managed to extract his Invisibility Cloak from under the bed screwed the top back on his jar of colorchange ink and forced the lid of his trunk shut on his cauldron Then heaving his trunk in one hand and holding Hedwigs cage in the other he made his way back downstairs He was disappointed to discover that Dumbledore was not waiting in the hall which meant that he had to return to the living room Nobody was talking Dumbledor e was humming quietly apparently quite at his ease but the at mosphere was thicker than cold custard and Harry did not dare look at the Dursleys as he said Professor Im ready now Good said Dumbledore Just o ne last thing then And he turned to speak to the Dursleys once more As you will no doubt be aware Harry comes of age in a years time No said Aunt Petunia speaki ng for the first time since Dumbledores arrival Im sorry said Dumbledore politely No he doesnt Hes a month younger than Dudl ey and Dudders doesnt turn eighteen unti l the year after next Ah said Dumbledore pleasantly but in the Wizarding world we come of age at seventeen WILL AND WONT 55 Uncle Vernon muttered Prepo sterous but Dumbledore ignored him Now as you already know the wizard called Lord Voldemort has returned to this country The Wizarding community is currently in a state of open warfar e Harry whom Lord Voldemort has already attempted to kill on a number of occasions is in even greater danger now than the da y when I left him upon your doorstep fifteen ye ars ago with a letter explaining about his parents murder and expressing the ho pe that you would care for him as though he we re your own Dumbledore paused and although his voice remained light and calm and he gave no obvious sign of anger Harry felt a kind of chill emanating from him and noticed that the Dursleys drew very slightly closer together You did not do as I asked You have never treated Harry as a son He has known nothing but neglect and often cruelty at your hands The best that can be said is that he has at least escaped the appalling damage you have inflicted upon the unfortunate boy sitting between you Both Aunt Petunia and Uncle Ve rnon looked around instinctively as though expecting to see someone other than Dudley squeezed between them Us mistreat Dudders What dyou began Uncle Vernon furiously but Dumbledore rais ed his finger for silence a silence which fell as though he had struck Uncle Vernon dumb The magic I evoked fifteen year s ago means that Harry has powerful protection while he can stil l call this house home However miserable he has been here however unwelcome however badly treated you have at least grudgingly allowed him houseroom This CHAPTER THREE 56 magic will cease to operate the mo ment that Harry turns seventeen in other words at the moment he becomes a man I ask only this that you allow Harry to return once more to this house before his seventeenth birthday which will ens ure that the protection continues until that time None of the Dursleys said anything Dudley was frowning slightly as though he was still t rying to work out when he had ever been mistreated Uncle Vernon looked as thou gh he had something stuck in his throat Aunt Petuni a however was oddly flushed Well Harry time for us to be off said Dumbledore at last standing up and straightening his lo ng black cloak Until we meet again he said to the Dursleys wh o looked as though that moment could wait forever as far as they were concerned and after doffing his hat he swept from the room Bye said Harry hastily to th e Dursleys and followed Dumbledore who paused beside Harry s trunk upon which Hedwigs cage was perched We do not want to be encumbered by these just now he said pulling out his wand again I shall send them to the Burrow to await us there However I would li ke you to bring yo ur Invisibility Cloak just in case Harry extracted his cloak from his trunk with some difficulty trying not to show Dumbledore the mess within When he had stuffed it into an inside pocket of his jacket Dumbledore waved his wand and the trunk cage and Hedwig vanished Dumbledore then waved his wand again and the front door opened onto cool misty darkness And now Harry let us step out into the night and pursue that flighty temptre ss adventure F O U R 57 HORACE SLUGHORN espite the fact that he had spent every waking moment of the past few days hoping de sperately that Dumbledore would indeed come to fetch him Harry felt distinctly awkward as they set off down Privet Drive together He had never had a proper conversation with the headmaster outside of Ho gwarts before there was usually a desk between them The memory of their last facetoface encounter kept intrud ing too and it rather heightened Harrys sense of embarra ssment he had shouted a lot on that occasion not to mention done his best to smash several of Dumbledores most prized possessions Dumbledore however seem ed completely relaxed Keep your wand at the read y Harry he said brightly But I thought Im not allowed to use magic outside school sir If there is an attack said Du mbledore I give you permission to use any counterjinx or curse that might occur to you However I do not think you need worry ab out being attacked tonight D CHAPTER FOUR 58 Why not sir You are with me said Dumb ledore simply This will do Harry He came to an abrupt halt at the end of Privet Drive You have not of course passed your Apparition Test he said No said Harry I thought you had to be seventeen You do said Dumbledore So you will need to hold on to my arm very tightly My left if you dont mind as you have noticed my wand arm is a little fragile at the moment Harry gripped Dumbledore s proffered forearm Very good said Dumbledore Well here we go Harry felt Dumbledores arm twist away from him and redoubled his grip the next thing he knew everything went black he was being pressed very hard from all directions he could not breathe there were iron bands tigh tening around his chest his eyeballs were being forced back into his head his eardrums were being pushed deeper into his skull and then He gulped great lungfuls of cold night air and opened his streaming eyes He felt as though he had just been forced through a very tight rubber tube It was a fe w seconds before he realized that Privet Drive had vanished He and Dumbledore were now standing in what appeared to be a dese rted village square in the center of which stood an old war memori al and a few be nches His comprehension catching up with his se nses Harry realized that he had just Apparated for the first time in his life Are you all right asked Dumb ledore looking down at him solicitously The sensation does take some getting used to Im fine said Harry rubbing his ears which felt as though HORACE SLUGHORN 59 they had left Privet Drive rather reluctantly But I think I might prefer brooms Dumbledore smiled drew his tr aveling cloak a little more tightly around his neck and said This way He set off at a brisk pace past an empty inn and a few houses According to a clock on a nearby church it was almost midnight So tell me Harry said Dumbledore Your scar has it been hurting at all Harry raised a hand unconsciousl y to his forehead and rubbed the lightningshaped mark No he said and Ive been wondering about that I thought it would be burning all the time no w Voldemorts getting so powerful again He glanced up at Dumbledore and saw that he was wearing a satisfied expression I on the other hand thought otherwise said Dumbledore Lord Voldemort has finally realized the dangerous access to his thoughts and feelings you have been enjoying It appears that he is now employing Occlumency against you Well Im not complaining sa id Harry who missed neither the disturbing dreams nor the startling flashes of insight into Voldemorts mind They turned a corner passing a telephone box and a bus shelter Harry looked sideways at Du mbledore again Professor Harry Er where exactly are we This Harry is the charming village of Budleigh Babberton And what are we doing here CHAPTER FOUR 60 Ah yes of course I havent told you said Dumbledore Well I have lost count of the number of times I have said this in recent years but we are once again on e member of staff short We are here to persuade an old colleague of mine to come out of retirement and return to Hogwarts How can I help with that sir Oh I think well find a use fo r you said Dumbledore vaguely Left here Harry They proceeded up a steep narrow street lined with houses All the windows were dark The odd chill that had lain over Privet Drive for two weeks persisted here too Thinking of dementors Harry cast a look over his should er and grasped his wand reassuringly in his pocket Professor why couldnt we just Apparate directly into your old colleagues house Because it would be quite as rude as kicking down the front door said Dumbledore Courtesy dictates that we offer fellow wizards the opportunity of denyin g us entry In any case most Wizarding dwellings are magically protected from unwanted Apparators At Hogwarts for instance you cant Apparate anywhe re inside the buildings or grounds said Harry quickly Hermione Granger told me And she is quite right We turn left again The church clock chimed midn ight behind them Harry wondered why Dumbledore did not consider it rude to call on his old colleague so late but now that co nversation had been established he had more pressing questions to ask Sir I saw in the Daily Prophet that Fudge has been sacked Correct said Dumbledore now turning up a steep side street HORACE SLUGHORN 61 He has been replaced as I am sure you also saw by Rufus Scrimgeour who used to be Head of the Auror office Is he Do you think hes good asked Harry An interesting question said Dumbledore He is able certainly A more decisive and forcef ul personality than Cornelius Yes but I meant I know what you meant Rufus is a man of action and having fought Dark wizards for most of his working life does not underestimate Lord Voldemort Harry waited but Dumbledore did not say anything about the disagreement with Scrimgeour that the Daily Prophet had reported and he did not have the nerve to pu rsue the subject so he changed it And sir I saw about Madam Bones Yes said Dumbledore quietly A terrible loss She was a great witch Just up here I think ouch He had pointed with his injured hand Professor what happ ened to your I have no time to explain no w said Dumbledore It is a thrilling tale I wish to do it justice He smiled at Harry who unde rstood that he was not being snubbed and that he had permission to keep asking questions Sir I got a Ministry of Magic leaflet by owl about security measures we should all take ag ainst the Death Eaters Yes I received one myself said Dumbledore still smiling Did you find it useful Not really No I thought not You have not asked me for instance what is m y f a v o r i t e f l a v o r o f j a m t o check that I am indeed Professor Dumbledore and not an impostor CHAPTER FOUR 62 I didnt Harry began not entirely sure whether he was being reprimanded or not For future reference Harry it is raspberry although of course if I were a Death Eater I would have been sure to research my own jam preferences befo re impersonating myself Er right said Harry Well on that leaflet it said something about Inferi What exactly are they The leaflet wasnt very clear They are corpses said Dumble dore calmly Dead bodies that have been bewitched to do a Dark wi zards bidding Inferi have not been seen for a long time however not since Voldemort was last powerful He killed enough people to make an army of them of course This is the place Harry just here They were nearing a small neat stone house set in its own garden Harry was too busy digesting the horrible idea of Inferi to have much attention left for anything else but as they reached the front gate Dumbledore stopped dead and Harry walked into him Oh dear Oh dear dear dear Harry followed his gaze up the carefully tended front path and felt his heart sink The front door was hanging off its hinges Dumbledore glanced up and down the street It seemed quite deserted Wand out and follow me Ha rry he said quietly He opened the gate and walked swiftly and silently up the garden path Harry at his heels then pushed the front door very slowly his wand raised and at the ready Lumos Dumbledores wand tip ignited casting its light up a narrow hallway To the left another door stood open Holding his illumiHORACE SLUGHORN 63 nated wand aloft Dumbledore walked into the sitting room with Harry right behind him A scene of total devastation met their eyes A grandfather clock lay splintered at their feet its face cracked its pendulum lying a little farther away like a dropped sw ord A piano was on its side its keys strewn across the floor The wr eckage of a fallen chandelier glittered nearby Cushions lay defl ated feathers oozing from slashes in their sides fragments of gla ss and china lay like powder over everything Dumbledore raised his wand even higher so that its light was thrown upon the walls where something darkly red and glutinous was spattered over the wa llpaper Harrys small intake of breath made Dumbledore look around Not pretty is it he said heavily Yes something horrible has happened here Dumbledore moved carefully into the middle of the room scrutinizing the wreckage at his fee t Harry followed gazing around halfscared of what he might see hidden behind the wreck of the piano or the overturned sofa but there was no sign of a body Maybe there was a fight and and they dragged him off Professor Harry suggested trying not to imagine how badly wounded a man would have to be to leave those stains spattered halfway up the walls I dont think so said Dumble dore quietly peering behind an overstuffed armchair lying on its side You mean hes Still here somewhere Yes And without warning Dumbledore swooped plunging the tip of his wand into the seat of the ov erstuffed armchair which yelled Ouch CHAPTER FOUR 64 Good evening Horace said Dumbledore straightening up again Harrys jaw dropped Where a split second before there had been an armchair there now crouched an enormously fat bald old man who was massaging his lower belly and squinting up at Dumbledore with an aggrieved and watery eye There was no need to stick the wand in that hard he said gruffly clambering to his feet It hurt The wandlight sparkled on his shiny pate his prominent eyes his enormous silver walruslike mustache and the highly polished buttons on the maroon velvet jacket he was wearing over a pair of lilac silk pajamas The top of his head barely reached Dumbledores chin What gave it away he grunted as he staggered to his feet still rubbing his lower belly He seem ed remarkably unabashed for a man who had just been discovered pretending to be an armchair My dear Horace said Dumble dore looking amused if the Death Eaters really had come to call the Dark Mark would have been set over the house The wizard clapped a pudgy ha nd to his vast forehead The Dark Mark he muttered Knew there was something ah well Wouldnt have had ti me anyway Id only just put the finishing touches to my upholstery when you entered the room He heaved a great sigh that made the ends of his mustache flutter Would you like my assistance clearing up asked Dumbledore politely Please said the other HORACE SLUGHORN 65 They stood back to back the ta ll thin wizard and the short round one and waved their wa nds in one identical sweeping motion The furniture flew back to its original places ornaments reformed in midair feathers zoomed into their cushions torn books repaired themselves as they landed upon their shelves oil lanterns soared onto side tables and reignited a vast collection of splintered silver picture frames flew glitte ring across the room and alighted whole and untarnished upon a desk rips cracks and holes healed everywhere and the walls wiped themselves clean What kind of blood was that in cidentally asked Dumbledore loudly over the chiming of th e newly unsmashed grandfather clock On the walls Dragon shouted the wizard called Horace as with a deafening grinding and tink ling the chandelier screwed itself back into the ceiling There was a final plunk from the piano and silence Yes dragon repeated the wizard conversationally My last bottle and prices are skyhigh at the moment Still it might be reusable He stumped over to a small crysta l bottle standing on top of a sideboard and held it up to the light examining the thick liquid within Hmm Bit dusty He set the bottle back on the sideboard and sighed It was then that his gaze fel l upon Harry Oho he said his large round eyes flying to Harrys forehead and the lightningshap ed scar it bore Oho CHAPTER FOUR 66 This said Dumbledore moving forward to make the introduction is Harry Potter Harry this is an old friend and colleague of mine Horace Slughorn Slughorn turned on Dumbledore his expression shrewd So thats how you thought youd persua de me is it Well the answers no Albus He pushed past Harry his face turned resolutely away with the air of a man trying to resist temptation I suppose we can have a drink at least asked Dumbledore For old times sake Slughorn hesitated All right then one drink he said ungraciously Dumbledore smiled at Harry and directed him toward a chair not unlike the one that Slughorn had so recently impersonated which stood right beside the newl y burning fire and a brightly glowing oil lamp Harry took the se at with the distinct impression that Dumbledore for some reason wanted to keep him as visible as possible Certainly when Slugho rn who had been busy with decanters and glasses turned to face the room again his eyes fell immediately upon Harry Hmpf he said looking away qu ickly as though frightened of hurting his eyes Here He gave a drink to Dumbledore who had sat down without invitation th rust the tray at Harry and then sank into the cushions of the re paired sofa and a disgruntled silence His legs were so shor t they did not touch the floor Well how have you been keeping Horace Dumbledore asked Not so well said Slughorn at once Weak chest Wheezy HORACE SLUGHORN 67 Rheumatism too Cant move like I used to Well thats to be expected Old age Fatigue And yet you must have moved fa irly quickly to prepare such a welcome for us at such short noti ce said Dumbledore You cant have had more than th ree minutes warning Slughorn said half irritably half proudly Two Didnt hear my Intruder Charm go off I was taking a bath Still he added sternly seeming to pull himself back togeth er again the fact remains that Im an old man Albus A tired ol d man whos earned the right to a quiet life and a few creature comforts He certainly had those thou ght Harry looking around the room It was stuffy and cluttered yet nobody could say it was uncomfortable there were soft ch airs and footstoo ls drinks and books boxes of chocolates and plump cushions If Harry had not known who lived there he would ha ve guessed at a rich fussy old lady Youre not yet as old as I am Horace said Dumbledore Well maybe you ought to thin k about retirement yourself said Slughorn bluntly His pale gooseberry eyes had found Dumbledores injured hand Reactions not what they were I see Youre quite right said Dumbledore serenely shaking back his sleeve to reveal the tips of those burned and blackened fingers the sight of them made th e back of Harrys neck prickle unpleasantly I am undoubtedly slower than I wa s But on the other hand He shrugged and spread his hands wide as though to say that age had its compensations and Ha rry noticed a ring on his uninjured hand that he had never s een Dumbledore wear before It was large rather clumsily made of wh at looked like gold and was set CHAPTER FOUR 68 with a heavy black stone that had cracked down the middle Slughorns eyes lingered for a mo ment on the ring too and Harry saw a tiny frown momentarily crease his wide forehead So all these precautions against intruders Horace are they for the Death Eaters benefit or mine asked Dumbledore What would the Death Eaters want with a poor brokendown old buffer like me demanded Slughorn I imagine that they would want you to turn your considerable talents to coercion torture and murder said Dumbledore Are you really telling me that they havent come recruiting yet Slughorn eyed Dumbledore bale fully for a moment then muttered I havent given them the chance Ive been on the move for a year Never stay in one place more than a week Move from Muggle house to Muggle house the owners of this place are on holiday in the Canary Islands its b een very pleasant Ill be sorry to leave Its quite easy once yo u know how one simple Freezing Charm on these absurd burglar alar ms they use instead of Sneakoscopes and make sure the neighbors dont spot you bringing in the piano Ingenious said Dumbledore But it sounds a rather tiring existence for a brokendown old buffer in search of a quiet life Now if you were to return to Hogwarts If youre going to tell me my li fe would be more peaceful at that pestilential school you can save your breath Albus I might have been in hiding but some funny ru mors have reached me since Dolores Umbridge left If thats how you treat teachers these days Professor Umbridge ran afoul of our centaur herd said Dumbledore I think you Horace would have known better than to HORACE SLUGHORN 69 stride into the forest and call a ho rde of angry centaurs filthy halfbreeds Thats what she did did she said Slughorn Idiotic woman Never liked her Harry chuckled and both Dumb ledore and Slughorn looked round at him Sorry Harry said hastily Its ju st I didnt like her either Dumbledore stood up rather suddenly Are you leaving asked Slughorn at once looking hopeful No I was wondering whether I might use your bathroom said Dumbledore Oh said Slughorn clearly disa ppointed Second on the left down the hall Dumbledore strode from the r oom Once the door had closed behind him there was silence Af ter a few moments Slughorn got to his feet but seemed uncertain what to do with himself He shot a furtive look at Harry then crossed to the fire and turned his back on it warming hi s wide behind Dont think I dont know why hes brought you he said abruptly Harry merely looked at Slughorn Slughorns watery eyes slid over Harrys scar this time taking in th e rest of his face You look very like your father Yeah Ive been told said Harry Except for your eyes Youve got My mothers eyes yeah Harry ha d heard it so often he found it a bit wearing Hmpf Yes well You shouldnt ha ve favorites as a teacher of CHAPTER FOUR 70 course but she was one of mine Yo ur mother Slughorn added in answer to Harrys questioning look Lily Evans One of the brightest I ever taught Vivacious you kn ow Charming girl I used to tell her she ought to have been in my House Very cheeky answers I used to get back too Which was your House I was Head of Slytherin said Slughorn Oh now he went on quickly seeing the expression on Harrys face and wagging a stubby finger at him dont go holding that against me Youll be Gryffindor like her I suppose Yes it usually goes in families Not always though Ever heard of Sirius Black You must have done been in the papers for the last couple of years died a few weeks ago It was as though an invisible ha nd had twisted Harrys intestines and held them tight Well anyway he was a big pal of your fathers at school The whole Black family had been in my House but Sirius ended up in Gryffindor Shame he was a ta lented boy I got his brother Regulus when he came along but Id have liked the set He sounded like an enthusiastic collector who ha d been outbid at auction Apparently lost in me mories he gazed at the opposite wall turning idly on the spot to ensure an even heat on his backside Your mother was Muggleborn of course Couldnt believe it when I found out Thought she mu st have been pureblood she was so good One of my best friends is Muggleborn said Harry and shes the best in our year Funny how that some times happens isnt it said Slughorn HORACE SLUGHORN 71 Not really sa id Harry coldly Slughorn looked down at him in surprise You mustnt think Im prejudiced he said No no no Havent I just said your mother was one of my alltime favorite students And there was Dirk Cresswell in the year afte r her too now Head of the Goblin Liaison Office of course another Muggleborn a very gifted student and still gives me excell ent inside information on the goingson at Gringotts He bounced up and down a little smiling in a selfsatisfied way and pointed at the many glitteri ng photograph frames on the dresser each peopled with tiny moving occupants All exstudents all signed Youll notice Barnabas Cuffe editor of the Daily Prophet hes always interested to hear my take on the days news And Ambrosius Flum e of Honeydukes a hamper every birthday and all because I wa s able to give him an introduction to Ciceron Harkiss who gave him his first job And at the back youll see her if you just crane your neck thats Gwenog Jones who of course captains th e Holyhead Harpies People are always astonished to hear I m on firstname terms with the Harpies and free tickets whenever I want them This thought seemed to cheer him up enormously And all these people know wher e to find you to send you stuff asked Harry who could no t help wondering why the Death Eaters had not yet tracked down Sl ughorn if hampers of sweets Quidditch tickets and visitors craving his advice and opinions could find him The smile slid from Slughorns face as quickly as the blood from his walls CHAPTER FOUR 72 Of course not he said look ing down at Harry I have been out of touch with ev erybody for a year Harry had the impression that the words shocked Slughorn himself he looked quite unsettled for a moment Then he shrugged Still the prudent wizard keep s his head down in such times All very well for Dumbledore to talk but taking up a post at Hogwarts just now would be tantamount to declaring my public allegiance to the Order of the Phoenix And while Im sure theyre very admirable and brave and all the rest of it I dont personally fancy the mortality rate You dont have to join the Order to teach at Hogwarts said Harry who could not quite keep a note of derision out of his voice It was hard to sympathize with Slughorns cosseted existence when he remembered Sirius crouching in a cave and living on rats Most of the teachers arent in it and none of them has ever been killed well unless you count Qu irrell and he got what he deserved seeing as he was working with Voldemort Harry had been sure Slughorn wo uld be one of those wizards who could not bear to hear Vold emorts name spoken aloud and was not disappointed Slughorn gave a shudder and a squawk of protest which Harry ignored I reckon the staff are safer than most people while Dumbledores headmaster hes supposed to be the only one Voldemort ever feared isnt he Harry went on Slughorn gazed into space for a moment or two He seemed to be thinking over Harrys words Well yes it is true that HeWhoMustNotBeNamed has never sought a fight with Dumbledore he muttered grudgingly HORACE SLUGHORN 73 And I suppose one could argue that as I have not joined the Death Eaters HeWhoMustNotBeNam ed can hardly count me a friend in which case I might well be safer a little closer to Albus I cannot pretend that Amel ia Boness death did not shake me If she with all her Ministry contacts and protection Dumbledore reentered the room and Slughorn jumped as though he had forgotten he was in the house Oh there you are Albus he said Youve been a very long time Upset stomach No I was merely reading the Muggle magazines said Dumbledore I do love knitting patterns Well Harry we have trespassed upon Horaces hospitality qu ite long enough I think it is time for us to leave Not at all reluctant to obey Harry jumped to his feet Slughorn seemed taken aback Youre leaving Yes indeed I think I know a lost cause when I see one Lost Slughorn seemed agitated He tw iddled his fat thumbs and fidgeted as he watched Dumbledore fa sten his traveling cloak and Harry zip up his jacket Well Im sorry you dont want th e job Horace said Dumbledore raising his uninjured hand in a farewell salute Hogwarts would have been glad to see you back again Our greatly increased security notwithstanding you will always be welcome to visit should you wish to Yes well very gracious as I say Goodbye then CHAPTER FOUR 74 Bye said Harry They were at the front door when there was a shout from behind them All right all right Ill do it Dumbledore turned to see Slughorn standing breathless in the doorway to the sitting room You will come ou t of retirement Yes yes said Slughorn impatien tly I must be mad but yes Wonderful said Dumbledore beaming Then Horace we shall see you on the first of September Yes I daresay you will grunted Slughorn As they set off down the garden pa th Slughorns voice floated after them Ill want a pay rise Dumbledore Dumbledore chuckled The garden gate swung shut behind them and they set off back down th e hill through the dark and the swirling mist Well done Harry said Dumbledore I didnt do anything said Harry in surprise Oh yes you did You showed Horace exactly how much he stands to gain by returning to Hogwarts Did you like him Er Harry wasnt sure whether he li ked Slughorn or not He supposed he had been pleasant in his wa y but he had also seemed vain a n d w h a t e v e r h e s a i d t o t h e c o ntrary much too surprised that a Muggleborn should make a good witch Horace said Dumbledore reli eving Harry of the responsibility to say any of this likes his comfort He also likes the company of the famous the successful and the powerful He enjoys the feeling that he influences these people He has never wanted to occupy HORACE SLUGHORN 75 the throne himself he prefers the ba ckseat more room to spread o u t y o u s e e H e u s e d t o h a n d p i c k f a v o r i t e s a t H o g w a r t s s o m e times for their ambition or their brains sometimes for their charm or their talent and he had an uncanny knack for choosing those who would go on to become outs tanding in their various fields Horace formed a kind of club of his favorites with himself at the center making introductions fo rging useful contacts between members and always reaping some kind of benefit in return whether a free box of his favorite crystali zed pineapple or the chance to recommend the next ju nior member of the Goblin Liaison Office Harry had a sudden and vivid ment al image of a great swollen spider spinning a web around it twitching a thread here and there to bring its large and ju icy flies a little closer I tell you all this Dumbledor e continued not to turn you against Horace or as we must now call him Professor Slughorn but to put you on your gu ard He will undoubtedly try to collect you Harry You would be th e jewel of his collection the Boy Who Lived or as they call you these days the Chosen One At these words a chill that had nothing to do with the surrounding mist stole ov er Harry He was reminded of words he had heard a few weeks ago words that had a horrible and particular meaning to him Neither can live whil e the other survives Dumbledore had stopped walking level with the church they had passed earlier This will do Harry If you will grasp my arm Braced this time Harry was read y for the Apparition but still found it unpleasant When the pre ssure disappeared and he found CHAPTER FOUR 76 himself able to breathe again he was standing in a country lane beside Dumbledore and looking ahead to the crooked silhouette of his second favorite buil ding in the world the Burrow In spite of the feeling of dread that had just swept through him his spirits could not help but lift at the sigh t of it Ron was in there and so was Mrs Weasley who could cook better than anyone he knew If you dont mind Harry said Dumbledore as they passed through the gate Id like a few wo rds with you before we part In private Perhaps in here Dumbledore pointed toward a rundown stone outhouse where the Weasleys kept their broomst icks A little puzzled Harry followed Dumbledore through the creaki ng door into a space a little smaller than the average cupboa rd Dumbledore illuminated the tip of his wand so that it glowed like a torch and smiled down at Harry I hope you will forgive me fo r mentioning it Harry but I am pleased and a little proud at how we ll you seem to be coping after everything that happened at the Mini stry Permit me to say that I think Sirius would have been proud of you Harry swallowed his voice seemed to have deserted him He did not think he could stand to disc uss Sirius it had been painful enough to hear Uncle Vernon say His godfathers dead and even worse to hear Siriuss name th rown out casually by Slughorn It was cruel said Dumbledore softly that you and Sirius had such a short time together A brutal ending to what should have been a long and happy relationship Harry nodded his eyes fixed resolu tely on the spider now climbing Dumbledores hat He could tell that Dumbledore understood HORACE SLUGHORN 77 that he might even suspect that un til his letter a rrived Harry had spent nearly all his time at the Durs leys lying on his bed refusing meals and staring at the misted window full of the chill emptiness that he had come to associate with dementors Its just hard Harry said finally in a low voice to realize he wont write to me again His eyes burned suddenly and he blinked He felt stupid for admitting it but the fact that he had had someone outside Hogwarts who cared what happened to him al most like a parent had been one of the best things about disc overing his godfather and now the post owls would never bring him that comfor t again Sirius represented much to you that you had never known before said Dumbledore gently Naturally the loss is devastating But while I was at the Dursleys interru pted Harry his voice growing stronger I realized I cant shut myself away or or crack up Sirius wouldnt have wanted that would he And anyway lifes too short Look at Madam Bones look at Emmeline Vance It could be me next co uldnt it But if it is he said fiercely now looking straight into Dumbledores blue eyes gleaming in the wandlight Ill make su re I take as many Death Eaters with me as I can and Voldemort too if I can manage it Spoken both like your mother an d fathers son and Siriuss true godson said Dumbledore with an approving pat on Harrys back I t a k e m y h a t o f f t o y o u o r I w o u l d i f I w e r e n o t a f r a i d o f showering you in spiders And now Harry on a closely rela ted subject I gather that you have been taking the Daily Prophet over the last two weeks Yes said Harry and his heart beat a little faster CHAPTER FOUR 78 Then you will have seen that there have been not so much leaks as floods concerning yo ur adventure in the Hall of Prophecy Yes said Harry again And now everyone knows that Im the one No they do not interrupted Dumbledore There are only two people in the whole world who know the full contents of the prophecy made about you and Lord Voldemort and they are both standing in this smelly spidery broom shed It is true however that many have guessed correctly that Voldemort sent his Death Eaters to steal a prophecy and th at the prophecy concerned you Now I think I am correct in sayi ng that you have not told anybody that you know what the prophecy said No said Harry A wise decision on the whole said Dumbledore Although I think you ought to relax it in fa vor of your friends Mr Ronald Weasley and Miss Hermione Granger Yes he continued when Harry looked startled I think they ought to know You do them a disservice by not confiding some thing this import ant to them I didnt want to worry or frighten them said Dumbledore surveying Harry over the top of his halfmoon spectacles Or perhaps to confess that you yourself are wo rried and frightened You need your friends Harry As you so ri ghtly said Sirius would not have wanted you to shut yourself away Harry said nothing but Dumbledo re did not seem to require an answer He continued On a different though related subject it is my wish that you take privat e lessons with me this year HORACE SLUGHORN 79 Private with you said Harry surprised out of his preoccupied silence Yes I think it is time that I t ook a greater hand in your education What will you be teaching me sir Oh a little of this a little of that said Dumbledore airily Harry waited hopefully but Dumb ledore did not elaborate so he asked something else that ha d been bothering him slightly If Im having lessons with you I wont have to do Occlumency lessons with Snape will I Professor Snape Harry and no you will not Good said Harry in relief because they were a He stopped careful not to say what he really thought I think the word fiasco woul d be a good one here said Dumbledore nodding Harry laughed Well that means I wont see much of Professor Snape from now on he said because he wont le t me carry on Potions unless I get Outstanding in my OWL which I know I havent Dont count your owls before they are delivered said Dumbledore gravely Which now I think of it ought to be some time later today Now two more things Harry before we part Firstly I wish you to keep your Invisibility Cloak with you at all times from this moment onward Even within Hogwarts itself Just in case you understand me Harry nodded And lastly while you stay here the Burrow has been given the CHAPTER FOUR 80 highest security the Mi nistry of Magic can provide These measures have caused a certain amount of inconvenience to Arthur and Molly all their post for instance is being searched at the Ministry before being sent on They do not mind in the slightest for their only concern is your safety However it would be poor repayment if you risked your neck while staying with them I understand sa id Harry quickly Very well then said Dumbledore pushing open the broom shed door and stepping out into the yard I see a light in the kitchen Let us not deprive Molly any longer of the chance to deplore how thin you are F I V E 81 AN EXCESS OF PHLEGM arry and Dumbledore approach ed the back door of the Burrow which was surrounded by the familiar litter of old Wellington boots and rusty ca uldrons Harry could hear the soft clucking of sleepy chickens coming from a distant shed Dumbledore knocked three times an d Harry saw sudden movement behind the kitchen window Whos there said a nervous voice he recognized as Mrs Weasleys Declare yourself It is I Dumbledore bringing Harry The door opened at once There stood Mrs Weasley short plump and wearing an old green dressing gown Harry dear Gracious Albus you gave me a fright you said not to expect you before morning We were lucky said Dumbledore ushering Harry over the threshold Slughorn proved much more persuadable than I had expected Harrys doing of cour se Ah hello Nymphadora H CHAPTER FIVE 82 Harry looked around and saw that Mrs Weasley was not alone despite the lateness of the hour A young witch with a pale heartshaped face and mousy brown hair was sitting at th e table clutching a large mug between her hands Hello Professor she said Wotcher Harry Hi Tonks Harry thought she looked drawn even ill and there was something forced in her sm ile Certainly her appe arance was less colorful than usual without her customary shade of bubblegumpink hair Id better be off she said quic kly standing up and pulling her cloak around her shoulders T hanks for the tea and sympathy Molly Please dont leave on my account said Dumbledore courteously I cannot stay I have urge nt matters to discuss with Rufus Scrimgeour No no I need to get going said Tonks not meeting Dumbledores eyes Night Dear why not come to dinner at the weekend Remus and MadEye are coming No really Molly thanks anyway Good night everyone Tonks hurried past Dumbledore an d Harry into the yard a few paces beyond the doorstep she tur ned on the spot and vanished into thin air Harry noticed that Mrs Weasley looked troubled Well I shall see you at Hogwarts Harry said Dumbledore Take care of yourself Molly your servant He made Mrs Weasley a bow an d followed Tonks vanishing at precisely the same spot Mrs Weas ley closed the door on the empty AN EXCESS OF PHLEGM 83 yard and then steered Harry by the shoulders into the full glow of the lantern on the table to examine his appearance Youre like Ron she sighed looking him up and down Both of you look as though youve had Stretching Jinxes put on you I swear Rons grown four inches since I last bought him school robes Are you hungry Harry Yeah I am said Harry sudd enly realizing just how hungry he was Sit down dear Ill knock something up As Harry sat down a furry ginger cat with a squashed face jumped onto his knees and settled there purring So Hermiones here he asked happily as he tickled Crookshanks behind the ears Oh yes she arrived the day befo re yesterday said Mrs Weasley rapping a large iron pot with her wand It bounced onto the stove with a loud clang and began to bubble at once Everyones in bed of course we di dnt expect you for hours Here you are She tapped the pot again it rose into the air flew toward Harry and tipped over Mrs Weasley slid a bowl neatly beneath it just in time to catch the stream of thick steaming onion soup Bread dear Thanks Mrs Weasley She waved her wand over her shoulder a loaf of bread and a knife soared gracefully onto the tabl e as the loaf sl iced itself and the soup pot dropped back onto the stove Mrs Weasley sat down opposite him So you persuaded Horace Sl ughorn to take the job Harry nodded his mouth so full of hot soup that he could not speak CHAPTER FIVE 84 He taught Arthur and me said Mrs Weasley He was at Hogwarts for ages started around the same time as Dumbledore I think Did you like him His mouth now full of bread Harry shrugged and gave a noncommittal jerk of the head I know what you mean said Mrs Weasley nodding wisely Of course he can be charming wh en he wants to be but Arthurs never liked him much The Ministry s littered with Slughorns old favorites he was always good at giving leg ups but he never had much time for Arthur didnt seem to think he was enough of a highflier Well that just shows yo u even Slughorn makes mistakes I dont know whether Rons told you in any of his letters its only just happened but Arthurs been promoted It could not have been clearer th at Mrs Weasley had been bursting to say this Harry swallowed a large amount of very hot soup and thought he could feel his throat blisteri ng Thats great he gasped You are sweet beamed Mrs We asley possibly taking his watering eyes for emotion at the new s Yes Rufus Scrimgeour has set up several new offices in response to the present situation and Arthurs heading the Office for th e Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Prot ective Objects Its a big job hes got ten people reporting to him now What exactly Well you see in all the panic about YouKnowWho odd things have been cropping up for sale everywhere things that are supposed to guard against YouKn owWho and the Death Eaters You can imagine the kind of thing socalled protective potions that are really gravy with a bit of bubotuber pus added or instrucAN EXCESS OF PHLEGM 85 tions for defensive jinxes that actual ly make your ears fall off Well in the main the perpetrators are just people like Mundungus Fletcher whove never done an hones t days work in their lives and are taking advantage of how frig htened everybody is but every now and then something really nasty turns up The other day Arthur confiscated a box of cursed Sneakoscopes that were almost certainly planted by a Death Eater So you see its a very important job and I tell him its just silly to miss dealing with spark plugs and toasters and all the rest of that Muggle rubbish Mrs Weasley ended her speech with a stern look as if it had been Harry suggesting that it was natura l to miss spark plugs Is Mr Weasley still at work Harry asked Yes he is As a matter of fact he s a tiny bit late He said hed be back around midnight She turned to look at a large clock that was pe rched awkwardly on top of a pile of sheets in the washing basket at the end of the table Harry recognized it at on ce It had nine hands each inscribed with the name of a fami ly member and usually hung on the Weasleys sitting room wall though its current position suggested that Mrs Weasley had taken to carrying it around the house with her Every single one of it s nine hands was now pointing at mortal peril Its been like that for a while now said Mrs Weasley in an unconvincingly casual voice ever since YouKnowWho came back into the open I suppose everybody s in mortal danger now I dont think it can be just our fami ly but I dont know anyone else whos got a clock like th is so I cant check Oh With a sudden exclamation she pointed at the clocks face Mr Weasleys hand had swit ched to traveling CHAPTER FIVE 86 Hes coming And sure enough a moment later there was a knock on the back door Mrs Weasley jumped up and hu rried to it with one hand on the doorknob and her face pres sed against the wood she called softly Arthur is that you Yes came Mr Weasleys weary voice But I would say that even if I were a Death Eate r dear Ask the question Oh honestly Molly All right all righ t What is your dearest ambition To find out how airplanes stay up Mrs Weasley nodded and turned the doorknob but apparently Mr Weasley was holding tight to it on the other side because the door remained firmly shut Molly Ive got to ask you your question first Arthur really this is just silly What do you like me to call yo u when were alone together Even by the dim light of the la ntern Harry could tell that Mrs Weasley had turned bright red he himself felt suddenly warm around the ears and neck and hast ily gulped soup clattering his spoon as loudly as he could against the bowl Mollywobbles whispered a mortified Mrs Weasley into the crack at the ed ge of the door Correct said Mr Weasley Now you can let me in Mrs Weasley opened the door to reveal her husband a thin balding redhaired wizard wear ing hornrimmed spectacles and a long and dusty tr aveling cloak I still dont see why we have to go through that every time you come home said Mrs Weasley still pink in the face as she helped AN EXCESS OF PHLEGM 87 her husband out of his cloak I mean a Death Eater might have forced the answer out of yo u before impersonating you I know dear but its Ministry procedure and I have to set an example Something smells good onion soup Mr Weasley turned hopefully in the direction of the table Harry We didnt expe ct you until morning They shook hands and Mr Weas ley dropped into the chair beside Harry as Mrs Weasley set a bo wl of soup in fr ont of him too Thanks Molly Its b een a tough night Some idiots started selling MetamorphMedals Just slin g them around your neck and youll be able to change your appearance at will A hundred thousand disguises all for ten Galleons And what really happens when you put them on Mostly you just turn a fairly unpleasant orange color but a couple of people have also sprouted tentaclelike warts all over their bodies As if St Mungos didnt have enough to do already It sounds like the sort of thing Fred and George would find funny said Mrs Weasley hesi tantly Are you sure Of course I am said Mr Weas ley The boys wouldnt do anything like that now no t when people are desperate for protection So is that why youre late MetamorphMedals No we got wind of a nasty ba ckfiring jinx down in Elephant and Castle but luckily the Magical Law Enforcement Squad had sorted it out by the time we got there Harry stifled a yawn behind his hand Bed said an undeceived Mrs Weasley at once Ive got Fred and Georges room all ready for you youll have it to yourself Why where are they Oh theyre in Diagon Alley sleep ing in the little flat over their CHAPTER FIVE 88 joke shop as theyre so busy said Mrs Weasley I must say I didnt approve at first but they do seem to ha ve a bit of a flair for business Come on dear your trunks already up there Night Mr Weasley said Ha rry pushing back his chair Crookshanks leapt lightly from his lap and slunk out of the room Gnight Harry said Mr Weasley Harry saw Mrs Weasley glance at the clock in the washing basket as they left the kitchen All the hands were once again at mortal peril Fred and Georges bedroom was on the second floor Mrs Weasley pointed her wand at a lamp on the bedside table and it ignited at once bathing the room in a pleasant golden glow Though a large vase of flowers had been placed on a desk in front of the small window their perfume could not di sguise the lingering smell of what Harry thought was gunpowde r A considerable amount of floor space was devoted to a vast number of unmarked sealed cardboard boxes amongst which stood Harrys school trunk The room looked as though it was being used as a temporary warehouse Hedwig hooted happily at Har ry from her perch on top of a large wardrobe then took off through the window Harry knew she had been waiting to see him before going hunting Harry bade Mrs Weasley good night put on pa jamas and got into one of the beds There was something hard in side the pillowcase He groped inside it and pulled out a sticky purpleandorange sweet which he recognized as a Puking Pastille Sm iling to himself he rolled over and was instantly asleep Seconds later or so it seemed to Harry he wa s awakened by what sounded like cannon fire as the door burst op en Sitting bolt upright he heard the rasp of th e curtains being pulled back The AN EXCESS OF PHLEGM 89 dazzling sunlight seemed to poke him hard in both eyes Shielding them with one hand he groped ho pelessly for his glasses with the other Wuzzgoinon We didnt know you were here al ready said a loud and excited voice and he received a sharp blow to the top of the head Ron dont hit him said a girls voice reproachfully Harrys hand found his glasses an d he shoved them on though the light was so bright he could hardly see anyway A long looming shadow quivered in front of him for a moment he blinked and Ron Weasley came into focu s grinning down at him All right Never been better said Harry rubbing the top of his head and slumping back onto his pillows You Not bad said Ron pulling over a cardboard box and sitting on it When did you get here Mums only just told us About one oclock this morning Were the Muggles all right Did they treat you okay Same as usual said Harry as Hermione perched herself on the edge of his bed they didnt talk to me much but I like it better that way Howre you Hermione Oh Im fine said Hermione who was scrutinizing Harry as though he was sickening for somet hing He thought he knew what was behind this and as he had no wish to discuss Siriuss death or any other miserable subject at th e moment he said Whats the time Have I missed breakfast Dont worry about that Mums bringing you up a tray she reckons you look underfed said Ro n rolling his eyes So whats been going on CHAPTER FIVE 90 N o t h i n g m u c h I v e j u s t b e e n stuck at my aunt and uncles havent I Come off it said Ron Youv e been off with Dumbledore It wasnt that exciting He just wanted me to help him persuade this old teacher to come out of retirement His names Horace Slughorn Oh said Ron looking di sappointed We thought Hermione flashed a warning look at Ron and Ron changed tack at top speed we thought itd be something like that You did said Harry amused Yeah yeah now Umbridge has left obviously we need a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher dont we So er whats he like He looks a bit like a walrus a n d h e u s e d t o b e H e a d o f Slytherin said Harry Som ething wrong Hermione She was watching him as though expecting strange symptoms to manifest themselves at any mom ent She rearranged her features hastily in an unco nvincing smile No of course not So um did Slughorn seem like hell be a good teacher Dunno said Harry He cant be worse than Umbridge can he I know someone whos worse than Umbridge said a voice from the doorway Rons younger si ster slouched into the room looking irritable Hi Harry Whats up with you Ron asked Its her said Ginny plonking herself down on Harrys bed Shes driving me mad AN EXCESS OF PHLEGM 91 Whats she done now asked Hermione sympathetically Its the way she talks to me youd think I was about three I know said Hermione dropping her voice Shes so full of herself Harry was astonished to hear Hermione talking about Mrs Weasley like this and could not blame Ron for saying angrily Cant you two lay off her for five seconds Oh thats right defend her snapped Ginny We all know you cant get enough of her This seemed an odd comment to make about Rons mother Starting to feel that he was mi ssing something Harry said Who are you But his question was answered b efore he could finish it The bedroom door flew open again an d Harry instinctiv ely yanked the bedcovers up to his chin so hard that Hermione and Ginny slid off the bed onto the floor A young woman was standing in the doorway a woman of such breathtaking beauty that the room seemed to have become strangely airless She was tall and willowy wi th long blonde ha ir and appeared to emanate a faint silvery glow To complete this vision of perfection she was carrying a heavily laden breakfast tray Arry she said in a throaty vo ice Eet as been too long As she swept over the threshol d toward him Mrs Weasley was revealed bobbing along in her wake looking rather cross There was no need to bring up the tray I was just about to do it myself Eet was no trouble said Fleur Delacour setting the tray across Harrys knees and then swooping to kiss him on each cheek He felt the places where her mouth had touched him burn I ave been CHAPTER FIVE 92 longing to see im You remember my seester Gabrielle She never stops talking about Arry Potter Sh e will be delighted to see you again Oh is she here too Harry croaked No no silly boy said Fleur with a tinkling laugh I mean next summer when we but do you not know Her great blue eyes widened an d she looked reproachfully at Mrs Weasley who said We hadnt got around to telling him yet Fleur turned back to Harry swingi ng her silvery sheet of hair so that it whipped Mrs Weasley across the face Bill and I are going to be married Oh said Harry blankly He coul d not help noticing how Mrs Weasley Hermione and Ginny were all determinedly avoiding one anothers gaze Wow Er congratulations She swooped down upon him and kissed him again Bill is very busy at ze moment working very ard and I only work parttime at Gringotts for my Eenglish so he brought me ere for a few days to get to know is fa mily properly I was so pleased to ear you would be coming zere isnt much to do ere unless you like cooking and chickens Well enjoy your brea kfast Arry With these words she turned grac efully and seemed to float out of the room closing the door quietly behind her Mrs Weasley made a noise th at sounded li ke tchah Mum hates her said Ginny quietly I do not hate her said Mrs Weas ley in a cross whisper I just think theyve hurried into th is engagement thats all Theyve known each other a year said Ron who looked oddly groggy and was starin g at the closed door Well thats not very long I kn ow why its happened of course AN EXCESS OF PHLEGM 93 Its all this uncertainty with Yo uKnowWho coming back people think they might be dead tomorrow so theyre rushing all sorts of decisions theyd normally take time over It was the same last time he was powerful people eloping left right and center Including you and Dad said Ginny slyly Yes well your father and I were made for each other what was the point in waiting said Mrs Weasley W hereas Bill and Fleur well what have they really got in common Hes a hardworking downtoearth sort of person whereas shes A cow said Ginny nodding B ut Bills not that downtoearth Hes a CurseBreaker isnt he he likes a bit of adventure a bit of glamour I expect thats why hes gone for Phlegm Stop calling her that Ginny sa id Mrs Weasley sharply as Harry and Hermione laughed Wel l Id better get on Eat your eggs while th eyre warm Harry Looking careworn she left the ro om Ron still seemed slightly punchdrunk he was shaking his head experimentally like a dog trying to rid its ears of water Dont you get used to her if sh es staying in the same house Harry asked Well you do said Ron but if she jumps out at you unexpectedly like then Its pathetic said Hermione furiously striding away from Ron as far as she could go and turning to face him with her arms folded once she had re ached the wall You dont really want her ar ound forever Ginny asked Ron incredulously When he merely shrugged she said Well Mums going to put a stop to it if she can I bet you anything Hows she going to manage that asked Harry CHAPTER FIVE 94 She keeps trying to get Tonks round for dinner I think shes hoping Bill will fall for Tonks inst ead I hope he does Id much rather have her in the family Yeah thatll work said Ron sarc astically List en no bloke in his right minds going to fancy Tonks when Fleurs around I mean Tonks is okaylooking when she isn t doing stupid things to her hair and her nose but Shes a damn sight nicer than Phlegm said Ginny And shes more intelligent shes an Auror said Hermione from the corner Fleurs not stupid she was g ood enough to enter the Triwizard Tournament said Harry Not you as well said Hermione bitterly I suppose you like the way Phle gm says Arry do you asked Ginny scornfully No said Harry wishing he hadn t spoken I was just saying Phlegm I mean Fleur Id much rather have Tonks in the family said Ginny At least shes a laugh She hasnt been much of a laugh lately said Ron Every time Ive seen her shes looked more like Moaning Myrtle Thats not fair snapped Hermio ne She still hasnt got over what happened you know I mean he wa s her cousin Harrys heart sank They had arrived at Sirius He picked up a fork and began shovelin g scrambled eggs into his mouth hoping to deflect any invitation to join in this part of the conversation Tonks and Sirius barely knew each other said Ron Sirius was in Azkaban half her life and before that their families never met AN EXCESS OF PHLEGM 95 Thats not the point said Herm ione She thinks it was her fault he died How does she work that one ou t asked Harry in spite of himself Well she was fighting Bellatrix Lestrange wasnt she I think she feels that if only she had finished her off Bellatrix couldnt have killed Sirius Thats stupid said Ron Its survivors guilt said Hermione I know Lupins tried to talk her round but shes still really down Shes actually having trouble with her Metamorphosing With her She cant change her appearance like she used to explained Hermione I think her powers must have been affected by shock or something I didnt know that coul d happen said Harry Nor did I said Hermione but I suppose if youre really depressed The door opened again and Mrs Weasley popped her head in Ginny she whispered come dow nstairs and help me with the lunch Im talking to this lot said Ginny outraged Now said Mrs Weasley and withdrew She only wants me there so she doesnt have to be alone with Phlegm said Ginny crossly She swung her long red hair around in a very good imitation of Fleur and pranced across the room with her arms held aloft like a ballerina You lot had better co me down quickly too sh e said as she left CHAPTER FIVE 96 Harry took advantage of the te mporary silence to eat more breakfast Hermione was peering into Fred and Georges boxes though every now and then she cast sideways looks at Harry Ron who was now helping himself to Harrys toast was still gazing dreamily at the door Whats this Hermione asked eventually holding up what looked like a small telescope Dunno said Ron but if Fred and Georgeve left it here its probably not ready for the joke shop yet so be careful Your mum said the sh ops going well said Harry Said Fred and George have got a real flair for business Thats an understatement said Ron Theyre raking in the Galleons I cant wait to see the pl ace we havent been to Diagon Alley yet because Mum says Dads got to be there for extra security and hes been really busy at work but it soun ds excellent And what about Percy asked Harry the thirdeldest Weasley brother had fallen out with the rest of the family Is he talking to your mum and dad again Nope said Ron But he knows your dad was ri ght all along now about Voldemort being back Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right said Hermione I heard him telling your mum Ron Sounds like the sort of ment al thing Dumbledore would say said Ron Hes going to be giving me private lessons this year said Harry conversationally AN EXCESS OF PHLEGM 97 Ron choked on his bit of to ast and Hermione gasped You kept that quiet said Ron I only just remembered said Harry honestly He told me last night in your broom shed Blimey private lessons with Dumbledore said Ron looking impressed I wond er why hes His voice tailed away Harry saw him and Hermione exchange looks Harry laid down his knife and fork his heart beating rather fast considering that all he was doing was sitting in bed Dumbledore had said to do it Why no t now He fixed his eyes on his fork which was gleaming in the sunlight stre aming into his lap and said I dont know exactly wh y hes going to be giving me lessons but I think it must be because of the prophecy Neither Ron nor Hermione spoke Harry had the impression that both had frozen He continued still speaking to his fork You know the one they were trying to steal at the Ministry Nobody knows what it said thou gh said Hermione quickly It got smashed Although the Prophet says began Ron but Hermione said Shh The Prophets got it right said Harry looking up at them both with a great effort Hermione seem ed frightened and Ron amazed That glass ball that smashed wa snt the only record of the prophecy I heard the whole thing in Dumbledores office he was the one the prophecy was made to so he could tell me From what it said Harry took a deep breath it looks like Im the one whos got to finish off Voldemort At least it said neither of us could live while the other survives CHAPTER FIVE 98 The three of them gazed at one another in silence for a moment Then there was a loud bang and Hermione vanished behind a puff of black smoke Hermione shouted Harry and Ron the breakfast tray slid to the floor with a crash Hermione emerged coughing ou t of the smoke clutching the telescope and sporting a bril liantly purple black eye I squeezed it and it it punched me she gasped And sure enough they now saw a tiny fist on a long spring protruding from the end of the telescope Dont worry said Ron who wa s plainly trying not to laugh Mumll fix that shes good at healing minor injuries Oh well never mind that now said Hermione hastily Harry oh Harry She sat down on the edge of his bed again We wondered after we got back from the Ministry Obviously we didnt want to say anything to you but from what Lucius Malfoy said about the prophecy how it was about you and Voldemort well we thought it might be something like this Oh Harry She stared at him then whispered Are you scared Not as much as I was said Ha rry When I first heard it I was but now it seems as though I always knew Id have to face him in the end When we heard Dumbledore was co llecting you in person we thought he might be telling you something or showing you something to do with the prophecy sa id Ron eagerly And we were kind of right werent we He wouldnt be giving you lessons if he thought you were a goner wouldnt waste his time he must think youve got a chance AN EXCESS OF PHLEGM 99 Thats true said Hermione I wonder what hell teach you Harry Really advanced defensive ma gic probably powerful countercurses antijinxes Harry did not really listen A warmth wa s spreading through him that had nothing to do with the sunlight a tight obstruction in his chest seemed to be disso lving He knew that Ron and Hermione were more shocked than they were letting on but the mere fact that they were still ther e on either side of him speaking bracing words of comfort not sh rinking from him as though he were contaminated or dangerous was worth more than he could ever tell them and evasive enchantments generally concluded Hermione Well at least you know one lesson youll be having this year thats one more than Ron and me I wonder when our OWL results will come Cant be long now its been a month said Ron Hang on said Harry as anothe r part of last nights conversation came back to him I th ink Dumbledore said our OWL results would be arriving today Today shrieked Hermione Today But why didnt you oh my God you should have said She leapt to her feet Im going to see whether an y owls have come But when Harry arrived downstair s ten minutes later fully dressed and carrying his empty breakfast tray it was to find Hermione sitting at the kitchen tabl e in great agitation while Mrs Weasley tried to lessen her resemblance to half a panda It just wont budge Mrs Weas ley was saying an xiously standing over Hermione with her wand in her hand and a copy of The CHAPTER FIVE 100 Healers Helpmate open at Bruises Cuts and Abrasions This has always worked before I just cant understand it Itll be Fred and Georges idea of a funny joke making sure it cant come off said Ginny But its got to come off squeaked Hermione I cant go around looking like this forever You wont dear well find an antidote dont worry said Mrs Weasley soothingly Bill told me ow Fred and George are very amusing said Fleur smiling serenely Yes I can hardly breathe for laughing snapped Hermione She jumped up and started walking round and round the kitchen twisting her fingers together Mrs Weasley youre quite quite sure no owls have arrived this morning Yes dear Id have noticed said Mrs Weasley patiently But its barely nine theres st ill plenty of time I know I messed up Ancient Runes muttered Hermione feverishly I definitely made at least one serious mistranslation And the Defense Against the Dark Arts practical was no good at all I thought Transfiguration went a ll right at the time but looking back Hermione will you shut up youre not the only one whos nervous barked Ron And when youve got your eleven Outstanding OWLs Dont dont dont said Hermione flapping her hands hysterically I know Ive failed everything What happens if we fail Harry as ked the room at large but it was again Hermione who answered AN EXCESS OF PHLEGM 101 We discuss our options with ou r Head of House I asked Professor McGonagall at th e end of last term Harrys stomach squirmed He wished he had eaten less breakfast At Beauxbatons said Fleur co mplacently we ad a different way of doing things I think eet was better We sat our examinations after six years of study not five and then Fleurs words were drowned in a scream Hermione was pointing through the kitchen window Three black specks were clearly visible in the sky growin g larger all the time Theyre definitely owls said Ron hoarsely jumping up to join Hermione at the window And there are three of them sa id Harry hastening to her other side One for each of us said Hermione in a terrified whisper Oh no oh no oh no She gripped both Harry and Ro n tightly around the elbows The owls were flying directly at the Burrow three handsome tawnies each of which it became clear as they flew lower over the path leading up to the house was carrying a large square envelope Oh no squealed Hermione Mrs Weasley squeezed past them and opened the kitchen window One two three the owls soar ed through it and landed on the table in a neat line All three of them lift ed their right legs Harry moved forward The letter addressed to him was tied to the leg of the owl in the middle He untied it with fumbling fingers To his left Ron was trying to detach his own results to his right Hermiones hands were shak ing so much she was making her whole owl tremble CHAPTER FIVE 102 Nobody in the kitchen spoke At last Harry managed to detach the envelope He slit it open qu ickly and unfolded the parchment inside Ordinary Wizarding Level Results Pass Grades Fail Grades Outstanding O Poor P Exceeds Expectations E Dreadful D Acceptable A Troll T Harry James Potter has achieved Astronomy ACare of Magical Creatures ECharms EDefense Against the Dark Arts O Divination PHerbology EHistory of Magic D Potions ETransfiguration E Harry read the parchment through several times his breathing becoming easier with each reading It was all right He had always known that he would fail Divinati on and he had had no chance of passing History of Magic given that he had collapsed halfway through the examination but he had passed everything else He ran his finger down the grades he had passed well in Transfiguration AN EXCESS OF PHLEGM 103 and Herbology he had even exceeded expectations at Potions And best of all he had achieved O utstanding at Defense Against the Dark Arts He looked around Hermione had her back to him and her head bent but Ron was lo oking delighted Only failed Divination and Hi story of Magic and who cares about them he said happily to Harry Here swap Harry glanced down Rons grades There were no Outstandings there Knew youd be top at Defense Against the Dark Arts said Ron punching Harry on the shoulder Weve done all right havent we Well done said Mrs Weasley proudly ruffling Rons hair Seven OWLs thats more than Fred and George got together Hermione said Ginny tentativ ely for Hermione still hadnt turned around H ow did you do I not bad said Hermione in a small voice Oh come off it said Ron st riding over to her and whipping her results out of her hand Yep nine Outstandings and one Exceeds Expectations at Defense Against the Dark Arts He looked down at her halfamused halfexasperated Youre actually disappointed arent you Hermione shook her head but Harry laughed Well were NEWT students now grinned Ron Mum are there any more sausages Harry looked back down at his resu lts They were as good as he could have hoped for He felt just one tiny twinge of regret This was the end of his ambition to become an Auror He had not CHAPTER FIVE 104 secured the required Potions grade He had known all along that he wouldnt but he still felt a sinkin g in his stomach as he looked again at that small black E It was odd really seeing that it had been a Death Eater in disguise who had first told Harry he would make a good Auror but somehow the idea had taken hold of him and he couldnt really think of anything else he would li ke to be Moreover it had seemed the right destiny for him since he had heard the prophecy a few weeks ago Neither can live while the other survives Wouldnt he be living up to the prophecy and giving himself the best chance of survival if he joined those hi ghly trained wizards whose job it was to find and kill Voldemort S I X 105 DRACOS DETOUR arry remained within the conf ines of the Burrows garden over the next few weeks He spent most of his days playing twoaside Quidditch in the Weasleys orchard he and Hermione against Ron and Ginny Hermione was dreadful and Ginny good so they were reason ably well matched and his evenings eating triple helpings of ev erything Mrs Weasley put in front of him It would have been a happy peacef ul holiday had it not been for the stories of disappearances odd accidents even of deaths now appearing almost daily in the Prophet Sometimes Bill and Mr Weasley brought home news before it even reached the paper To Mrs Weasleys displeasure Harrys sixteenth birthday celebrations were marred by grisly tidings brought to the party by Remus Lupin who was looking gaunt and grim his brown hair streaked liberally with gray his clothes mo re ragged and patched than ever There have been another couple of dementor attacks he H CHAPTER SIX 106 announced as Mrs Weasley passe d him a large slice of birthday cake And theyve found Igor Karkaroffs body in a shack up north The Dark Mark had been set over it well frankly Im surprised he stayed alive for even a year after deserting the Death Eaters Siriuss brother Regulus only managed a few days as far as I can remember Yes well said Mrs Weasley frowning perhaps we should talk about something diff Did you hear about Florean Fo rtescue Remus asked Bill who was being plied with wine by Fleur The man who ran the icecream place in Diag on Alley Harry interrupted with an unpleasant hollow sensation in the pit of his stomach He used to give me free ice crea ms Whats happ ened to him Dragged off by the look of his place Why asked Ron while Mrs Weasley pointedly glared at Bill Who knows He mustve upset them somehow He was a good man Florean Talking of Diagon Alley said Mr Weasley looks like Ollivanders gone too The wandmaker said Gi nny looking startled T h a t s t h e o n e S h o p s e m p t y N o s i g n o f a s t r u g g l e N o o n e knows whether he left voluntarily or was kidnapped But wands whatll people do for wands Theyll make do with other makers said Lupin But Ollivander was the best and if the other side have got him its not so good for us The day after this rather gloomy birthday tea their letters and booklists arrived from Hogwarts Harrys included a surprise He had been made Quidditch Captain DRACOS DETOUR 107 That gives you equal status with prefects cried Hermione happily You can use our specia l bathroom now and everything Wow I remember when Charlie wore one of these said Ron examining the badge with glee Ha rry this is so cool youre my Captain if you let me back on the team I suppose ha ha Well I dont suppose we can put off a trip to Diagon Alley much longer now youve got these sighed Mrs Weasley looking down Rons booklist Well go on Sa turday as long as your father doesnt have to go into work again Im not going there without him Mum dyou honestly think You KnowWhos going to be hiding behind a bookshelf in Flourish and Blotts sniggered Ron Fortescue and Ollivander went on holiday did they said Mrs Weasley firing up at once If yo u think securitys a laughing matter you can stay behi nd and Ill get your things myself No I wanna come I want to see Fred and Georges shop said Ron hastily Then you just buck up your ideas young man before I decide youre too immature to come with us said Mrs Weasley angrily snatching up her clock all nine ha nds of which were still pointing at mortal peril and balancing it on top of a pile of justlaundered towels And that goes for retu rning to Hogwarts as well Ron turned to stare incredulously at Harry as his mother hoisted the laundry basket and the teet ering clock into her arms and stormed out of the room Blimey you cant even make a joke round here anymore But Ron was careful not to be flippant about Voldemort over the next few days Saturday dawned wi thout any more outbursts from Mrs Weasley though she seemed very tense at breakfast Bill who CHAPTER SIX 108 would be staying at home with Fleur much to Hermione and Ginnys pleasure passed a full mo ney bag across the table to Harry Wheres mine demanded Ro n at once his eyes wide Thats already Harrys idiot sa id Bill I got it out of your vault for you Harry because its taking about five hours for the public to get to thei r gold at the moment the goblins have tightened security so much Two days ago Arkie Philpott had a Probity Probe stuck up his Well trust me th is ways easier Thanks Bill said Harry pocketing his gold E is always so thoughtful purred Fleur adoringly stroking Bills nose Ginny mimed vomiting into her cereal behind Fleur Harry choked over his cornflakes and Ron thumped him on the back It was an overcast murky day One of the special Ministry of Magic cars in which Harry had ri dden once before was awaiting them in the front yard when they emerged from the house pulling on their cloaks Its good Dad can get us these ag ain said Ron appreciatively stretching luxuriously as the ca r moved smoothly away from the Burrow Bill and Fleur waving from the kitchen window He Harry Hermione and Ginny were all sitting in roomy comfort in the wide backseat Dont get used to it its only because of Harry said Mr Weasley over his shoulder He and Mrs Weasley were in front with the Ministry driver the front passenger seat had obligi ngly stretched into what resembled a twoseater sofa Hes been given topgrade security status And well be joining up with additional security at the Leaky Cauldron too Harry said nothing he did not much fancy doing his shopping DRACOS DETOUR 109 while surrounded by a battalion of Aurors He had stowed his Invisibility Cloak in his backpack and felt that if that was good enough for Dumbledore it ought to be good enough for the Ministry though now he came to think of it he was not sure the Ministry knew about his cloak Here you are then said the dr iver a surprisingly short while l a t e r s p e a k i n g f o r t h e f i r s t t i m e a s h e s l o w e d i n C h a r i n g C r o s s Road and stopped outside the Leak y Cauldron Im to wait for you any idea how long youll be A couple of hours I expect said Mr Weasley Ah good hes here Harry imitated Mr Weasley and peered through the window his heart leapt There were no Au rors waiting outside the inn but instead the gigantic blackbearde d form of Rubeus Hagrid the Hogwarts gamekeeper wearing a long beaverskin coat beaming at the sight of Harrys face and oblivious to the startled stares of passing Muggles Harry he boomed sweeping Harry into a bonecrushing hug the moment Harry had stepped out of the car Buckbeak Witherwings I mean yeh should see him Harry hes so happy ter be back in the open air Glad hes pleased said Harry gr inning as he massaged his ribs We didnt know security meant you I know jus like old times inni t See the Ministry wanted ter send a bunch o Aurors but Dumbledore said Id do said Hagrid proudly throwing out his chest and tucking his thumbs into his pockets Lets get goin then after yeh Molly Arthur The Leaky Cauldron wa s for the first time in Harrys memory completely empty Only Tom the landlord wizened and toothless CHAPTER SIX 110 remained of the old crowd He l ooked up hopefully as they entered but before he could speak Hagrid said importantly Jus passin through today Tom sure yeh understand Hogwarts business yeh know Tom nodded gloomily and returned to wiping glasses Harry Hermione Hagrid and the Weasleys walked through the bar and out into the chilly little courtyar d at the back where the dustbins stood Hagrid raised hi s pink umbrella and ra pped a certain brick in the wall which opened at once to form an archway onto a winding cobbled street They stepped through the entrance and paused looking around Diagon Alley had changed The co lorful glittering window displays of spellbooks potion ingredi ents and cauldrons were lost to view hidden behind the large Mini stry of Magic posters that had been pasted over them Most of th ese somber purple posters carried blownup versions of the securi ty advice on the Ministry pamphlets that had been sent out over the summer but others bore moving blackandwhite photograph s of Death Eaters known to be on the loose Bellatrix Lestrange was sneering from the front of the nearest apothecary A few window s were boarded up including those of Florean Fortescues Ice Cream Parlor On the other hand a number of shabbylooking stalls had sprung up along the street The nearest one which had been erected outside Flourish and Blotts under a striped staine d awning had a cardboard sign pinned to its front AMULETS Effective Against Werewolves Dementors and Inferi DRACOS DETOUR 111 A seedylooking little wizard was rattling armfuls of silver symbols on chains at passersby One for your little girl madam he called at Mrs Weasley as they passed leering at Ginny Protect her pretty neck If I were on duty said Mr Weasley glaring angrily at the amulet seller Yes but dont go arresting anyo ne now dear were in a hurry said Mrs Weasley nervously consu lting a list I think wed better do Madam Malkins first Hermione wants new dress robes and Rons showing much too much ankl e in his school robes and you must need new ones too Harry youve grown so much come on everyone Molly it doesnt make sense for all of us to go to Madam Malkins said Mr Weasley Why don t those three go with Hagrid a n d w e c a n g o t o F l o u r i s h a n d B l otts and get everyones schoolbooks I dont know said Mrs Weasley anxiously clearly torn between a desire to finish the shoppi ng quickly and the wish to stick together in a pack Hag rid do you think Don fret theyll be fine with me Molly said Hagrid soothingly waving an airy hand the si ze of a dustbin lid Mrs Weasley did not look entirely convinced but allowed the separation scurrying off toward Flourish and Bl otts with her husband and Ginny while Harry Ron Hermione and Hagrid set off for Madam Malkins Harry noticed that many of the pe ople who passed them had the same harried anxious look as Mrs Weasley and that nobody was stopping to talk anymore the shoppers stay ed together in their CHAPTER SIX 112 own tightly knit groups moving intently about their business Nobody seemed to be shopping alone Migh be a bit of a squeeze in there with all of us said Hagrid stopping outside Madam Malkin s and bending down to peer through the window Ill stan d guard outside all right So Harry Ron and Hermione entere d the little shop together It appeared at first glance to be empty but no sooner had the door swung shut behind them than they heard a familiar voice issuing from behind a rack of dress ro bes in spangled green and blue not a child in case you havent noticed Mother I am perfectly capable of doing my shopping alone There was a clucking noise and a voice Harry recognized as that of Madam Malkin the owner said Now dear your mothers quite right none of us is suppose d to go wandering around on our own anymore its nothing to do with being a child Watch where youre sticki ng that pin will you A teenage boy with a pale pointe d face and whiteblond hair appeared from behind the rack wear ing a handsome set of dark green robes that glittered with pins ar ound the hem and the edges of the sleeves He strode to the mirror an d examined himself it was a few moments before he noticed Harry Ron and Hermione reflected over his shoulder His li ght gray eyes narrowed If youre wondering what the smell is Mother a Mudblood just walked in said Draco Malfoy I dont think theres any need fo r language like that said Madam Malkin scurrying out from behind the clothes rack holding a tape measure and a wand A nd I dont want wands drawn in my shop either she added hastily for a glance toward the door DRACOS DETOUR 113 had shown her Harry an d Ron both standing there with their wands out and pointing at Malf oy Hermione who was standing slightly behind them whispered No dont honestly its not worth it Yeah like youd dare do magic out of school sneered Malfoy Who blacked your eye Granger I want to send them flowers Thats quite enough said Ma dam Malkin sharply looking over her shoulder for suppo rt Madam please Narcissa Malfoy strolled out from behind the clothes rack Put those away she said cold ly to Harry and Ron If you attack my son again I shall ensure th at it is the last thing you ever do Really said Harry ta king a step forward and gazing into the smoothly arrogant face that for all its pallor still resembled her sisters He was as tall as she was no w Going to get a few Death Eater pals to do us in are you Madam Malkin squealed and clutched at her heart Really you shouldnt accuse dangerous thing to say wands away please But Harry did not lower his wa nd Narcissa Malfoy smiled unpleasantly I see that being Dumbledores favorite has given you a false sense of security Harry Potter But Dumbledore wont always be there to protect you Harry looked mockingly all around the shop Wow look at that hes not here now So why not have a go They might be able to find you a double cell in Azkaban with your loser of a husband CHAPTER SIX 114 Malfoy made an angry movement toward Harry but stumbled over his overlong robe Ron laughed loudly Dont you dare talk to my mother like that Potter Malfoy snarled Its all right Draco said Na rcissa restrainin g him with her thin white fingers upon his should er I expect Potter will be reunited with dear Sirius before I am reunited with Lucius Harry raised his wand higher Harry no moaned Hermione grabbing his arm and attempting to push it down by his side Thin k You mustnt Youll be in such trouble Madam Malkin dithered for a mom ent on the spot then seemed to decide to act as though no thing was happening in the hope that it wouldnt She bent toward Malfoy who was still glaring at Harry I think this left sleeve could co me up a little bit more dear let me just Ouch bellowed Malfoy slappi ng her hand away Watch where youre putting your pins woman Mother I dont think I want these anymore He pulled the robes over his head and threw them onto the floor at Madam Malkins feet Youre right Draco said Na rcissa with a contemptuous glance at Hermione now I know t h e k i n d o f s c um that shops here Well do better at Twilfitt and Tattings And with that the pair of them strode out of the shop Malfoy taking care to bang as hard as he could into Ron on the way out Well really said Madam Malkin snat ching up the fallen robes DRACOS DETOUR 115 and moving the tip of her wand over them like a vacuum cleaner so that it remo ved all the dust She was distracted all through the fitting of Rons and Harrys new robes tried to sell Hermione wizards dress robes instead of witchs and when she finally bowe d them out of th e shop it was with an air of being glad to see the back of them Got evrything asked Hagrid brightly when they reappeared at his side Just about said Harry Did you see the Malfoys Yeah said Hagrid unconcerned Bu they wouldn dare make trouble in the middle o Diagon Alley Harry Don worry abou them Harry Ron and Hermione exchan ged looks but before they could disabuse Hagrid of this comfortable notion Mr and Mrs Weasley and Ginny appeared all clutching heavy packages of books Everyone all right said Mrs We asley Got your robes Right then we can pop in at the Apot hecary and Eeylops on the way to Fred and Georges stic k close now Neither Harry nor Ron bought an y ingredients at the Apothecary seeing that they were no lo nger studying Potions but both bought large boxes of owl nuts fo r Hedwig and Pigwidgeon at Eeylops Owl Emporium Then with Mr s Weasley checking her watch every minute or so they headed fart her along the street in search of Weasleys Wizard Wheezes the joke shop run by Fred and George We really havent got too long Mrs Weasley said So well just have a quick look around and then back to the car We must be close thats number ninetyt wo ninetyfour CHAPTER SIX 116 Whoa said Ron stopping in his tracks Set against the dull postermuffled shop fronts around them Fred and Georges windows hit the eye like a firework display Casual passersby were looking back over their shoulders at the windows and a few rather stunnedl ooking people had actually come to a halt transfixed The lefthan d window was dazzlingly full of an assortment of goods that revolved popped flashed bounced and shrieked Harrys eyes began to wate r just looking at it The righthand window was covered with a gi gantic poster purple like those of the Ministry but emblazoned with flashing yellow letters WHY ARE YOU WORRYING ABOUT YOUKNOW WHO YOU SHOULD BE WORRYING ABOUT UNOPOO THE CONSTIPATION SENSATION THATS GRIPPING THE NATION Harry started to laugh He heard a weak sort of moan beside him and looked around to see Mrs Weasley gazing dumbfounded at the poster Her lips moved silently mouthing the na me UNoPoo Theyll be murdered in th eir beds she whispered No they wont said Ron who like Harry was laughing This is brilliant And he and Harry led the way into the shop It was packed with customers Harry could not get near the shelves He stared around looking up at the boxes piled to th e ceiling Here were the Skiving Snackboxes that the twins had per fected during their last unfin DRACOS DETOUR 117 ished year at Hogwarts Harry noti ced that the Nosebleed Nougat was most popular with only one battered box left on the shelf There were bins full of trick wa nds the cheapest merely turning into rubber chickens or pairs of briefs when waved the most expensive beating the unwary user around the head and neck and boxes of quills which came in SelfInking SpellChecking and SmartAnswer varieties A space cleared in the crowd and Harry pushed his way toward the counte r where a gaggle of delighted tenyearolds was watching a tiny little wooden man slowly ascending the steps to a real set of gallows both perched on a box that read reusable hangman spell it or hell swing Patented Daydream Charms Hermione had managed to squeeze through to a large display near the counter and was reading th e information on the back of a box bearing a highly colored pict ure of a handsome youth and a swooning girl who were standing on the deck of a pirate ship One simple incantation and yo u will enter a topquality highly realistic thirtyminute daydre am easy to fit into the average school lesson and virtually undetectable side effects include vacant expression and minor drooling No t for sale to undersixteens You know said Hermione looking up at Harry tha t really is extraordinary magic For that Hermione said a vo ice behind them you can have one for free A beaming Fred stood before th em wearing a set of magenta robes that clashed magnificen tly with his flaming hair How are you Harry They shook hands And whats happened to your eye Hermione CHAPTER SIX 118 Your punching telescope she said ruefully Oh blimey I forgot about those said Fred Here He pulled a tub out of his pocket and handed it to her she unscrewed it gingerly to reveal a thick yellow paste Just dab it on that bruisell be gone within the hour said Fred We had to find a decent bruise re mover Were test ing most of our products on ourselves Hermione looked nervous It is safe isnt it she asked Course it is said Fred brac ingly Come on Harry Ill give you a tour Harry left Hermione dabbing her black eye with paste and followed Fred toward the back of th e shop where he saw a stand of card and rope tricks Muggle magic tricks said Fred happily pointing them out For freaks like Dad you know wh o love Muggle stuff Its not a big earner but we do fairly steady business theyre great novelties Oh heres George Freds twin shook Harrys hand energetically Giving him the tour Come through the ba ck Harry thats where were making the real money pocket anything you and youll pay in more than Galleons he added warningly to a small boy who hastily whipped his hand out of the tub labeled edible dark marks theyll make anyone sick George pushed back a curtain beside the Muggle tricks and Harry saw a darker less crowded room The packaging on the products lining these shelves was more subdued Weve just developed this more serious line said Fred Funny how it happened DRACOS DETOUR 119 You wouldnt believe how many people even people who work at the Ministry cant do a decent Shield Charm said George Course they didnt have you teaching them Harry Thats right Well we thought Shield Hats were a bit of a laugh you know challenge your ma te to jinx you while wearing it and watch his face when the jinx ju st bounces off But the Ministry bought five hundred for all its supp ort staff And were still getting massive orders So weve expanded into a rang e of Shield Cloaks Shield Gloves I mean they wouldnt help much against the Unforgivable Curses but for minor to modera te hexes or jinxes And then we thought wed get into the whole area of Defense Against the Dark Arts because its such a money spinner continued George enthusiastically This is cool Look Instant Darkness Powder were importing it from Peru Handy if you want to make a quick escape And our Decoy Detonators are just walking off the shelves look said Fred pointing at a number of weirdlooking black horntype objects that were indeed attempting to scurry out of sight You just drop one surreptitiously and itll run off and make a nice loud noise out of sight giving you a dive rsion if you need one Handy said Harry impressed Here said George catching a couple and throwing them to Harry A young witch with short blonde hair poked her head around the curtain Harry saw that she too wa s wearing magenta staff robes CHAPTER SIX 120 Theres a customer out here l ooking for a joke cauldron Mr Weasley and Mr Weasley she said Harry found it very odd to hear Fr ed and George called Mr Weasley but they took it in their stride Right you are Verity Im coming said George promptly Harry you help yourself to an ything you want all right No charge I cant do that said Harry who had already pulled out his money bag to pay for the Decoy Detonators You dont pay here said Fr ed firmly waving away Harrys gold But You gave us our startup loan we havent forgotten said George sternly Take whatever you like and just remember to tell people where you got it if they ask George swept off through the curtain to help with the customers and Fred led Harry back into the main part of the shop to find Hermione and Ginny still pori ng over the Patented Daydream Charms Havent you girls found our special WonderWitch products yet asked Fred Follo w me ladies Near the window was an array of violently pink products around which a cluster of excited girls was giggling enthusiastically Hermione and Ginny both hung back looking wary There you go said Fred proudly Best range of love potions youll find anywhere Ginny raised an eyebrow skeptically Do they work she asked Certainly they work for up to twentyfour hours at a time depending on the weight of the boy in question DRACOS DETOUR 121 and the attractiveness of the girl said George reappearing suddenly at their side But were no t selling them to our sister he added becoming suddenly stern not when shes already got about five boys on the go from what weve Whatever youve heard from Ron is a big fat lie said Ginny calmly leaning forward to take a small pink pot off the shelf Whats this Guaranteed tensecond pimple va nisher said Fred Excellent on everything from boils to blac kheads but dont change the subject Are you or are you not curre ntly going out with a boy called Dean Thomas Yes I am said Ginny And la st time I looked he was definitely one boy not five What are those She was pointing at a number of ro und balls of fluff in shades of pink and purple all rolling around the bottom of a cage and emitting highpitched squeaks Pygmy Puffs said George M iniature puffskeins we cant breed them fast enough So what about Michael Corner I dumped him he was a bad loser said Ginny putting a finger through the bars of the cage and watching the Pygmy Puffs crowd around it Theyre really cute Theyre fairly cuddly yes conc eded Fred But youre moving through boyfriends a bi t fast arent you Ginny turned to look at him her hands on her hips There was such a Mrs Weasleyish glare on her face that Harry was surprised Fred didnt recoil Its none of your business And Ill thank you she added angrily to Ron who had just appeared at Georges elbow laden with merchandise not to tell tales about me to these two CHAPTER SIX 122 Thats three Galleons nine Sickles and a Knut said Fred examining the many boxes in Rons arms Cough up Im your brother And thats our stuff youre ni cking Three Galleons nine Sickles Ill knock off the Knut But I havent got three Galleons nine Sickles Youd better put it back then and mind you put it on the right shelves Ron dropped several boxes swor e and made a rude hand gesture at Fred that was unfortunat ely spotted by Mrs Weasley who had chosen that mo ment to appear If I see you do that again Ill jinx your fingers together she said sharply Mum can I have a Pygmy Pu ff said Ginny at once A what said Mr s Weasley warily Look theyre so sweet Mrs Weasley moved aside to look at the Pygmy Puffs and Harry Ron and Hermione momentarily had an unimpeded view out of the window Draco Malfoy was hurrying up the street alone As he passed Weasleys Wizard Wh eezes he glanced over his shoulder Seconds later he moved beyond the scope of the window and they lost sight of him Wonder where his mummy is said Harry frowning Given her the slip by the looks of it said Ron Why though said Hermione Harry said nothing he was thinking too ha rd Narcissa Malfoy would not have let her precious son out of her sight willingly Malfoy must have made a real effort to free himself from her clutches DRACOS DETOUR 123 Harry knowing and loathing Malfoy was sure the reason could not be innocent He glanced around Mrs Weasley and Ginny were bending over the Pygmy Puffs Mr Weasley was de lightedly examining a pack of Muggle marked playing cards Fred and George were both helping customers On the other side of the glass Hagrid was standing with his back to them look ing up and down the street Get under here quick said Harry pulling his Invisibility Cloak out of his bag Oh I dont know Harry said Hermione looking uncertainly toward Mrs Weasley Come on said Ron She hesitated for a second longer then ducked under the cloak with Harry and Ron Nobody noti ced them vanish they were all too interested in Fred and George s products Harry Ron and Hermione squeezed their way out of th e door as quickly as they could but by the time they gained the st reet Malfoy had disappeared just as successfully as they had He was going in that direction murmured Harry as quietly as possible so that the humming Hagrid would not hear them Cmon They scurried along peering le ft and right through shop windows and doors until He rmione pointed ahead Thats him isnt it she wh ispered Turning left Big surprise whispered Ron For Malfoy had glanced around then slid into Knockturn Alley and out of sight Quick or well lose him said Harry speeding up CHAPTER SIX 124 Our feetll be seen said He rmione anxiously as the cloak flapped a little around their ankles it was much more difficult hiding all three of them under the cloak nowadays It doesnt matter said Har ry impatiently Just hurry But Knockturn Alley the side street devoted to the Dark Arts looked completely deserted They peered into windows as they passed but none of the shops seemed to have any customers at all Harry supposed it was a bit of a giveaway in these dangerous and suspicious times to buy Dark artifa cts or at least to be seen buying them Hermione gave his arm a hard pinch Ouch Shh Look Hes in there she breathed in Harrys ear They had drawn level with the only shop in Knockturn Alley that Harry had ever visited Borgin and Burkes which sold a wide variety of sinister objects There in the midst of the cases full of skulls and old bottles stood Draco Malfoy with his back to them just visible beyond the very same large black cabinet in which Harry had once hidden to avoid Malf oy and his father Judging by the movements of Malfoys hands he was talking animatedly The proprietor of the shop Mr Borgin an oilyhaired stooping man stood facing Malfoy He was wearin g a curious expression of mingled resentment and fear If only we could hear what th eyre saying said Hermione We can said Ron excitedl y Hang on damn He dropped a couple more of the boxes he was still clutching as he fumbled with the largest Extendable Ears look Fantastic said Hermione as Ron unraveled the long fleshDRACOS DETOUR 125 colored strings and began to feed them toward the bottom of the door Oh I hope the door isnt Imperturbable No said Ron gleefully Listen They put their heads together and listened intently to the ends of the strings through which Malf oys voice could be heard loud and clear as though a radio had been turned on you know how to fix it Possibly said Borgin in a tone that suggested he was unwilling to commit himself Ill need to see it though Why dont you bring it into the shop I cant said Malfoy Its got to stay put I just need you to tell me how to do it Harry saw Borgin lick his lips nervously Well without seeing it I must sa y it will be a very difficult job perhaps impossible I couldnt guarantee anything No said Malfoy and Harry knew just by his tone that Malfoy was sneering Perhaps this will make you more confident He moved toward Borgin and was blocked from view by the cabinet Harry Ron and Hermione shuffled sideways to try and keep him in sight but all they could see was Borgin looking very frightened Tell anyone said Malfoy and there will be retribution You know Fenrir Greyback Hes a family friend Hell be dropping in from time to time to make sure yo ure giving the problem your full attention There will be no need for Ill decide that said Malfoy W ell Id better be off And dont forget to keep that one safe Ill need it Perhaps youd like to take it now CHAPTER SIX 126 No of course I wouldnt you stupid little man how would I look carrying that down the street Just dont sell it Of course not sir Borgin made a bow as deep as the one Harry had once seen him give Lucius Malfoy Not a word to anyone Borgin and that includes my mother understand Naturally naturall y murmured Borgin bowing again Next moment the bell over the door tinkled loudly as Malfoy stalked out of the shop looking very pleased with himself He passed so close to Harry Ron and Hermione that they felt the cloak flutter around their knees again Inside the shop Borgin remained frozen his unctuous smile had vanished he looked worried What was that about whispere d Ron reeling in the Extendable Ears Dunno said Harry thinking hard He wants something mended and he wants to reserv e something in there Could you see what he pointed at when he said that one No he was behind that cabinet You two stay here whispered Hermione What are you But Hermione had already ducked out from under the cloak She checked her hair in the reflec tion in the glass then marched into the shop setting the bell ti nkling again Ron hastily fed the Extendable Ears back under the door and passed one of the strings to Harry Hello horrible morning isnt it Hermione said brightly to Borgin who did not answer but ca st her a suspicious look HumDRACOS DETOUR 127 ming cheerily Hermione strolled th rough the jumble of objects on display Is this necklace for sale sh e asked pausing beside a glassfronted case If youve got one and a half thousand Galleons said Mr Borgin coldly Oh er no I havent got qu ite that much said Hermione walking on And what about this lovely um skull Sixteen Galleons So its for sale then It isn t being kept for anyone Mr Borgin squinted at her Ha rry had the nasty fee ling he knew exactly what Hermione was up to Apparently Hermione felt she had been rumbled too because she suddenly threw caution to the winds The thing is that er boy who was in here just now Draco Malfoy well hes a friend of mine and I want to get him a birthday present but if hes already reserved anything I obviously dont want to get him the same thing so um It was a pretty lame story in Harrys opinion and apparently Borgin thought so too Out he said sharply Get out Hermione did not wait to be asked twic e but hurried to the door with Borgin at her heels As the bell tinkled again Borgin slammed the door behind her and put up the closed sign Ah well said Ron throwing the cloak back over Hermione Worth a try but you were a bit obvious Well next time you can show me how its done Master of Mystery she snapped Ron and Hermione bickered al l the way back to Weasleys CHAPTER SIX 128 Wizard Wheezes where they were forc ed to stop so that they could dodge undetected around a very anxiouslooking Mrs Weasley and Hagrid who had clearly noticed their absence Once in the shop Harry whipped off the Invisibility Cloak hid it in his bag and joined in with the other two when they insisted in answer to Mrs Weasleys accusations that they had been in the back room all along and that she could not have looked properly S E V E N 129 THE SLUG CLUB arry spent a lot of the last we ek of the holidays pondering the meaning of Malfoys behavior in Knockturn Alley What disturbed him most wa s the satisfied look on Malfoys face as he had left the shop Not hing that made Malfoy look that happy could be good news To his slight annoyance however neither Ron nor Hermione seemed quite as curious about Malfoys activities as he was or at least they seemed to get bored of discussing it after a few days Yes Ive already agreed it was fishy Harry said Hermione a little impatiently She was sitting on the windowsill in Fred and Georges room with he r feet up on one of th e cardboard boxes and had only grudgingly looked up from her new copy of Advanced Rune Translation But havent we agreed there could be a lot of explanations Maybe hes broken his Hand of Glory said Ron vaguely as he H CHAPTER SEVEN 130 attempted to straighten his broomsticks bent tail twigs Remember that shriveledup arm Malfoy had B u t w h a t a b o u t w h e n h e s a i d D o n t f o r g e t t o k e e p that one safe asked Harry for the umpte enth time That sounded to me like Borgins got another one of the broken objects and Malfoy wants both You reckon said Ron now tryi ng to scrape some dirt off his broom handle Yeah I do said Harry Wh en neither Ron no r Hermione answered he said Malfoys fathers in Azkaban Dont you think Malfoyd like revenge Ron looked up blinking Malfoy revenge What can he do about it Thats my point I dont know sa id Harry frustrated But hes up to something and I think we should take it seriously His fathers a Death Eater and Harry broke off his eyes fixe d on the window behind Hermione his mouth open A startling thought had just occurred to him Harry said Hermio ne in an anxious vo ice Whats wrong Your scars not hurting again is it asked Ron nervously Hes a Death Eater said Harry sl owly Hes replaced his father as a Death Eater There was a silence then Ron erupted in laughter Malfoy Hes sixteen Harry You think YouKnowWho would let Malfoy join It seems very unlikely Harry sa id Hermione in a repressive sort of voice What makes you think In Madam Malkins She didnt touch him but he yelled and jerked his arm away from her when she went to roll up his sleeve It was his left arm Hes been branded with the Dark Mark THE SLUG CLUB 131 Ron and Hermione look ed at each other Well said Ron soundi ng thoroughly unconvinced I think he just wanted to get out of there Harry said Hermione He showed Borgin something we couldnt see Harry pressed on stubbornly Something that seri ously scared Borgin It was the Mark I know it he was showing Borgin who he was dealing with you saw how seriou sly Borgin took him Ron and Hermione exchanged another look Im not sure Harry Yeah I still dont reckon Yo uKnowWho would let Malfoy join Annoyed but absolutely convinced he was right Harry snatched up a pile of filthy Qu idditch robes and left the room Mrs Weasley had been urging them for days not to leave their wa shing and packing until the last moment On the landing he bumped into Ginny who was returning to her room car rying a pile of freshly laundered clothes I w o u l d n t g o i n t h e k i t c h en just now she warned him Theres a lot of Phlegm around Ill be careful not to slip in it Harry smiled Sure enough when he entered the kitchen it was to find Fleur sitting at the kitchen ta ble in full flow abou t plans for her wedding to Bill while Mrs Weasley kept watch over a pile of selfpeeling sprouts looking badtempered Bill and I ave almost decided on only two bridesmaids Ginny and Gabrielle will look very sweet togezzer I am theenking of dressing zem in pale gold pink would of course be orrible with Ginnys air CHAPTER SEVEN 132 Ah Harry said Mrs Weasle y loudly cutting across Fleurs monologue Good I wanted to ex plain about the security arrangements for the journey to Hogwarts tomorrow Weve got Ministry cars again and there will be Au rors waiting at the station Is Tonks going to be there asked Harry handing over his Quidditch things No I dont think so shes been stationed somewhere else from what Arthur said She has let erself go zat Tonk s Fleur mused examining her own stunning reflection in the ba ck of a teaspoon A big mistake if you ask Yes thank you said Mrs Weasley ta rtly cutting across Fleur again Youd better get on Harry I want the trunks ready tonight if possible so we dont have the usual lastminute scramble And in fact their departure the following morning was smoother than usual The Ministry cars glid ed up to the front of the Burrow to find them waiting trunks pa cked Hermiones cat Crookshanks safely enclosed in his traveling ba sket and Hedwig Rons owl Pigwidgeon and Ginnys new purple Pygmy Puff Arnold in cages Au revoir Arry said Fleur throatily kissing him goodbye Ron hurried forward looking ho peful but Ginny stuck out her foot and Ron fell sprawling in the dust at Fleurs feet Furious redfaced and dirtspattered he hurri ed into the car without saying goodbye There was no cheerful Hagrid wait ing for them at Kings Cross Station Instead two grimfaced bearded Aurors in dark Muggle suits moved forward the moment th e cars stopped and flanking the party marched them into the station without speaking Quick quick through the barri er said Mrs Weasley who THE SLUG CLUB 133 seemed a little flustere d by this austere effi ciency Harry had better go first with She looked inquiringly at one of the Aurors who nodded briefly seized Harrys upper arm and attempted to steer him toward the barrier between platfo rms nine and ten I can walk thanks said Harry irritably jerking his arm out of the Aurors grip He pushed his trolley directly at the solid barrier ignoring his silent companion and found himself a second later standing on platform nine and threequarters where the scarlet Hogwarts Express stood belchi ng steam over the crowd Hermione and the Weasleys join ed him within seconds Without waiting to consult his grimfaced Auror Harry motioned to Ron and Hermione to follow him up the platform looking for an empty compartment We cant Harry said Hermione looking apologetic Ron and Ive got to go to the prefects carri age first and then patrol the corridors for a bit Oh yeah I forgot said Harry Youd better get straight on the tr ain all of you youve only got a few minutes to go said Mrs Weasley consulting her watch Well have a lovely term Ron Mr Weasley can I have a quic k word said Harry making up his mind on the spur of the moment Of course said Mr Weasley who looked slightly surprised but followed Harry out of earsho t of the others nevertheless Harry had thought it through carefully and come to the conclusion that if he was to tell an yone Mr Weasley was the right person firstly because he worked at the Ministry and was therefore in the best position to make further investigations and secondly CHAPTER SEVEN 134 because he thought that there was not too much risk of Mr Weasley exploding with anger He could see Mrs Weasley and the grimfaced Auror casting the pair of them suspicious looks as they moved away When we were in Diagon Alle y Harry began but Mr Weasley forestalled him with a grimace Am I about to discover where you Ron and Hermione disappeared to while you were supposed to be in the back room of Fred and Georges shop How did you Harry please Youre talking to the man who raised Fred and George Er yeah all right we werent in the back room Very well then lets hear the worst Well we followed Draco Malfoy We used my Invisibility Cloak Did you have any particular re ason for doing so or was it a mere whim Because I thought Malfoy was up to something said Harry disregarding Mr Weasleys look of mingled exasperation and amusement Hed given his mother the sl ip and I wanted to know why Of course you did said Mr Weasley sounding resigned Well Did you find out why He went into Borgin and Burkes said Harry and started bullying the bloke in there Borgin to help him fix something And he said he wanted Borgin to keep so mething else for him He made it sound like it was the same kind of thing that needed fixing Like they were a pa ir And Harry took a deep breath THE SLUG CLUB 135 Theres something else We saw Malfoy jump about a mile when Madam Malkin tried to touch his left arm I think hes been branded with the Dark Mark I think hes replaced his father as a Death Eater Mr Weasley looked taken abac k After a moment he said Harry I doubt whether YouKnowWho would allow a sixteenyearold Does anyone really know what YouKnowWho would or wouldnt do asked Harry angrily Mr Weasley Im sorry but isnt it worth investigating If Malfoy wants something fixing and he needs to threaten Borgin to get it done its probably something Dark or dangerous isnt it I doubt it to be honest Harry said Mr Weasley slowly You see when Lucius Malfoy was arre sted we raided his house We took away everything that might have been dangerous I think you missed something said Harry stubbornly Well maybe said Mr Weasley but Harry could tell that Mr Weasley was humoring him There was a whistle behind them nearly everyone had boarded the train and the doors were closing Youd better hurry said Mr We asley as Mrs Weasley cried Harry quickly He hurried forward and Mr and Mrs Weasley helped him load his trunk onto the train Now dear youre coming to us fo r Christmas its all fixed with Dumbledore so well see you qu ite soon said Mrs Weasley through the window as Harry sl ammed the door shut behind him and the train began to move You make sure you look after yourself and CHAPTER SEVEN 136 The train was gathering speed be good and She was jogging to keep up now stay safe Harry waved until the train had turned a corner and Mr and Mrs Weasley were lost to view th en turned to see where the others had got to He supposed Ron and He rmione were cloistered in the prefects carriage but Ginny was a little way along the corridor chatting to some friends He made his way toward her dragging his trunk People stared shamelessly as he approached They even pressed their faces against the windows of their compartments to get a look at him He had expected an upswin g in the amount of gaping and gawping he would have to endure this term after all the Chosen One rumors in the Daily Prophet but he did not enjoy the sensation of standing in a very bright spotlight He tapped Ginny on the shoulder Fancy trying to fi nd a compartment I cant Harry I said Id meet Dean said Ginny brightly See you later Right said Harry He felt a stra nge twinge of annoyance as she walked away her long red hair da ncing behind her he had become so used to her presence over the summer that he had almost forgotten that Ginny did not hang around with him Ron and Hermione while at school Then he blinked and looked around He was surrounded by mesmerized girls Hi Harry said a familiar voice from behind him Neville said Harry in relief turning to see a roundfaced boy struggling toward him THE SLUG CLUB 137 Hello Harry said a girl with long hair and large misty eyes who was just be hind Neville Luna hi how are you Very well thank you said Lu na She was clutching a magazine to her chest large letters on th e front announced that there was a pair of free Spectrespecs inside Quibbler still going strong then asked Harry who felt a certain fondness for the magazine havi ng given it an exclusive interview the previous year Oh yes circulations well up said Luna happily Lets find seats said Harry an d the three of them set off along the train through hordes of silently staring students At last they found an empty compartment and Harry hurried inside gratefully Theyre even staring at us said Neville indicating himself and Luna Because were with you Theyre staring at you because you were at the Ministry too said Harry as he hoisted his tr unk into the luggage rack Our little adventure there was all over the Daily Prophet you mustve seen it Yes I thought Gran would be angry about all the publicity said Neville but she was really pleased Says Im starting to live up to my dad at long last She bought me a new wand look He pulled it out and showed it to Harry Cherry and unicorn hair he said proudly We think it was one of the last Ollivander ever sold he vanished next day oi come back here Trevor And he dived under the seat to retr ieve his toad as it made one of its frequent bids for freedom Are we still doing DA meetin gs this year Ha rry asked Luna CHAPTER SEVEN 138 who was detaching a pair of psyche delic spectacles from the middle of The Quibbler No point now weve got rid of Um bridge is there said Harry sitting down Neville bumped his head against the seat as he emerged from under it He looked most disappointed I liked the DA I learned loads with you I enjoyed the meetings too sa id Luna serenely It was like having friends This was one of those uncomfortable things Luna often said and which made Harry feel a squirming mixture of pity and embarrassment Before he could respond however there was a disturbance outside their compartment door a group of fourthyear girls was whispering and giggling together on the other side of the glass You ask him No you Ill do it And one of them a boldlooking girl with large dark eyes a prominent chin and long black hair pushed her way through the door Hi Harry Im Romilda Romild a Vane she said loudly and confidently Why dont you join us in our compartment You dont have to sit with them she added in a stage whisper indicating Nevilles bottom which was st icking out from under the seat again as he groped around for Trevor and Luna who was now wearing her free Spectrespecs which gave her the look of a demented multicolored owl Theyre friends of mine said Harry coldly Oh said the girl looking very surprised Oh Okay And she withdrew sliding th e door closed behind her THE SLUG CLUB 139 People expect you to have cooler friends than us said Luna once again displaying her knac k for embarrassing honesty You are cool said Harry shortl y None of them was at the Ministry They didnt fight with me Thats a very nice thing to say beamed Luna Then she pushed her Spectrespecs farther up her nose and settled down to read The Quibbler We didnt face him though said Neville emerging from under the seat with fluff and dust in his hair and a resignedlooking Trevor in his hand You did You should hear my gran talk about you That Harry Potters got more b ackbone than the whole Ministry of Magic put together Shed give anything to have you as a grandson Harry laughed uncomfortably an d changed the subject to OWL results as soon as he could While Neville recited his grades and wondered aloud whether he wo uld be allowed to take a Transfiguration NEWT with only an Acceptable Harry watched him without really listening Nevilles childhood had been blig hted by Voldemort just as much as Harrys had but Neville had no idea how close he had come to having Harrys destiny The prophecy could have referred to either of them yet for his own inscrutable reasons Voldemort had chosen to believe that Harry was the one meant Had Voldemort chosen Neville it would be Neville sitting opposite Harry bearing the lightningshaped scar and the weight of the prophecy Or would it Wo uld Nevilles mother have died to save him as Lily had died fo r Harry Surely she would But what if she had been unable to stand between her son and Voldemort Would there then have been no Chosen One at all An CHAPTER SEVEN 140 empty seat where Neville now sa t and a scarless Harry who would have been kissed goodbye by his own mother not Rons You all right Harry You look funny said Neville Harry started Sorry I Wrackspurt got you asked Luna sympathetically peering at Harry through her enormo us colored spectacles I what A Wrackspurt Theyre invisi ble They float in through your ears and make your brain go fuzzy she said I thought I felt one zooming around in here She flapped her hands at thin ai r as though beating off large invisible moths Harry and Neville caught each others eyes and hastily began to talk of Quidditch The weather beyond th e train windows was as patchy as it had been all summer they passed throug h stretches of the chilling mist then out into weak clear sunlight It was during one of the clear spells when the sun was visible al most directly overhead that Ron and Hermione entered th e compartment at last Wish the lunch trolley would hurry up Im starving said Ron longingly slumping into the se at beside Harry and rubbing his stomach Hi Neville Hi Luna Guess what he added turning to Harry Malfoys not doing prefec t duty Hes just sitting in his compartment with the other Sl ytherins we saw him when we passed Harry sat up straight interested It was not like Malfoy to pass up the chance to demonstrate his power as prefect which he had happily abused all the previous year What did he do when he saw you The usual said Ron indifferentl y demonstrating a rude hand THE SLUG CLUB 141 gesture Not like him though is it Well that is he did the hand gesture again but why is nt he out there bullying first years Dunno said Harry but his mind was racing Didnt this look as though Malfoy had more impo rtant things on his mind than bullying younger students Maybe he preferred the Inquisit orial Squad said Hermione Maybe being a prefect seem s a bit tame after that I dont think so said Harry I think hes But before he could expound on his theory the compartment door slid open again and a breathle ss thirdyear girl stepped inside Im supposed to deliver these to Neville Longbottom and Harry PPotter she faltered as her eyes met Harrys and she turned scarlet She was holding out two scroll s of parchment ti ed with violet ribbon Perplexed Harry and Neville took the scroll addressed to each of them and the girl stumbled back out of the compartment What is it Ron demanded as Harry unrolled his An invitation said Harry Harry I would be delighted if you wo uld join me for a bite of lunch in compartment C Sincerely Professor H E F Slughorn Whos Professor Slughorn aske d Neville look ing perplexedly at his own invitation New teacher said Harry Well I suppose well have to go wont we CHAPTER SEVEN 142 But what does he want me fo r asked Neville nervously as though he was expe cting detention No idea said Harry which was not entirely true though he had no proof yet that his hunch was correct Listen he added seized by a sudden br ain wave lets go under the Invisibility Cloak then we might get a good l ook at Malfoy on the way see what hes up to This idea however came to nothing The corridors which were packed with people on the lookout for the lunch trolley were impossible to negotiate while wearing the cloak Harry stowed it regretfully back in his bag reflecting that it would have been nice to wear it just to avoid all the starin g which seemed to have increased in intensity even since he had la st walked down the train Every now and then students would hurt le out of their compartments to get a better look at him Th e exception was Cho Chang who darted into her compartment when she saw Harry coming As Harry passed the window he saw her deep in determined conversation with her friend Marietta who was wearing a very thick layer of makeup that did not entirely obscure the odd formation of pimples still etched across her face Sm irking slightly Harry pushed on When they reached compartment C they saw at once that they were not Slughorns only invitees although judging by the enthusiasm of Slughorns welcome Harry was the most warmly anticipated Harry mboy said Slughorn ju mping up at the sight of him so that his great velvetcovered be lly seemed to fill all the remaining space in the compartment Hi s shiny bald head and great silvery mustache gleamed as brightly in the sunlight as the golden THE SLUG CLUB 143 buttons on his waistcoat Good to see you good to see you And you must be Mr Longbottom Neville nodded looking scared At a gesture from Slughorn they sat down opposite each othe r in the only two empty seats which were nearest the door Harry glanced around at their fellow guests He recognized a Slytherin from their year a tall black boy with high cheekbones and long slan ting eyes there were also two seventhyear boys Harry did not kn ow and squashed in the corner beside Slughorn and looking as th ough she was not entirely sure how she had got there Ginny Now do you know everyone Slughorn asked Harry and Neville Blaise Zabini is in your year of course Zabini did not make any sign of recognition or greeting nor did Harry or Neville Gryffindor and Slytherin student s loathed each other on principle This is Cormac McLaggen perh aps youve come across each other No McLaggen a large wiryhaired yo uth raised a hand and Harry and Neville nodde d back at him and this is Marcus Belby I dont know whether Belby who was thin an d nervouslooking gave a strained smile and this charming young lady tells me she knows you Slughorn finished Ginny grimaced at Harry and Nevi lle from behind Slughorns back Well now this is most pleasa nt said Slughorn cozily A chance to get to know you all a little better Here take a napkin Ive packed my own lunch the trolle y as I remember it is heavy on CHAPTER SEVEN 144 licorice wands and a poor old man s digestive system isnt quite up to such things Pheasant Belby Belby started and accepted what lo oked like half a cold pheasant I was just telling young Marcus here that I had the pleasure of teaching his Uncle Damocles Slughorn told Harry and Neville now passing around a basket of rolls Outstanding wizard outstanding and his Order of Merlin most welldeserved Do you see much of your uncle Marcus Unfortunately Belby had just ta ken a large mouthful of pheasant in his haste to answer Slugho rn he swallowed too fast turned purple and began to choke Anapneo said Slughorn calmly poin ting his wand at Belby whose airway seemed to clear at once Not not much of him no gasped Belby his eyes streaming Well of course I daresay hes busy said Slughorn looking questioningly at Belby I doubt he invented the Wolfsbane Potion without considerable hard work I suppose said Belby who seemed afraid to take another bite of pheasant until he was sure that Slughorn had finished with him Er he and my dad dont get on very well you see so I dont really know much about His voice tailed away as Slugho rn gave him a cold smile and turned to McLaggen instead Now you Cormac said Slughorn I happen to know you see a lot of your Uncle Tiberius beca use he has a rather splendid picture of the two of you hunting nogtails in I think Norfolk Oh yeah that was fun that was said McLaggen We went with Bertie Higgs and Rufus Scrimgeour this was before he became Minister obviously THE SLUG CLUB 145 Ah you know Bertie and Rufu s too beamed Slughorn now offering around a small tray of pies somehow Belby was missed out Now tell me It was as Harry had suspected Everyone here seemed to have been invited because they were connected to somebody wellknown or influential everyone except Ginny Zabini who was interrogated after McLaggen turned out to have a famously beautiful witch for a mother from wh at Harry could make out she had been married seven times each of her husbands dying mysteriously and leaving her mo unds of gold It wa s Nevilles turn next This was a very uncomfortable ten minutes for Nevilles parents wellknown Aurors had been tortured into insanity by Bellatrix Lestrange and a couple of Death Eater cronies At the end of Nevilles interview Harry had the impression that Slughorn was reserving judgment on Neville yet to see whether he had any of his parents flair And now said Slughorn shifting massively in his seat with the air of a compere introducing his star act Harry Potter Where to begin I feel I barely scratched the surface when we met over the summer He contemplated Harry for a moment as though he was a particularly large and succulen t piece of pheasant then said The Chosen One theyre calling you now Harry said nothing Belby McLagg en and Zabini were all staring at him Of course said Slughorn watc hing Harry closely there have been rumors for years I re member when well after that terrible night Lily James an d you survived and the word was that you must have po wers beyond the ordinary Zabini gave a tiny little coug h that was clearly supposed to CHAPTER SEVEN 146 indicate amused skepticism An angry voice burst out from behind Slughorn Yeah Zabini because youre so talented at posing Oh dear chuckled Slughorn co mfortably looking around at Ginny who was glaring at Zabini around Slughorns great belly You want to be careful Blaise I saw this young lady perform the most marvelous BatBogey Hex as I was passing her carriage I wouldnt cross her Zabini merely looked contemptuous Anyway said Slughorn turning back to Harry Such rumors this summer Of course one doesn t know what to believe the Prophet has been known to print in accuracies make mistakes but there seems little doubt given the number of witnesses that there was quite a disturbance at the Ministry and that you were there in the thic k of it all Harry who could not see any way out of this without flatly lying nodded but still said noth ing Slughorn beamed at him So modest so modest no wonder Dumbledore is so fond you were there then But the rest of th e stories so sensational of course one doesnt know quite what to believe this fabled prophecy for instance We never heard a prophecy said Neville turning geranium pink as he said it Thats right said Ginny staunchly Neville and I were both there too and all this Chos en One rubbish is just the Prophet making things up as usual You were both there too were you said Slughorn with great interest looking from Ginny to Nevi lle but both of them sat clamlike before his en couraging smile THE SLUG CLUB 147 Yes well it is true that the Prophet often exaggerates of course Slughorn said soun ding a little disappointed I remember dear Gwenog telling me Gwenog Jones I mean of course Captain of the Holyhead Harpies He meandered off into a long winded reminiscence but Harry had the distinct impression that Slughorn had not finished with him and that he had not been convinced by Neville and Ginny The afternoon wore on with mo re anecdotes about illustrious wizards Slughorn had taught all of whom had been delighted to join what he called the Slug Club at Hogwarts Harry could not wait to leave but couldnt see how to do so politely Finally the train emerged from yet another lo ng misty stretch into a red sunset and Slughorn looked around blinking in the twilight Good gracious its getting dark already I didnt notice that theyd lit the lamps Youd better go and change into your robes all of you McLaggen you must drop by and borrow that book on nogtails Harry Blaise any time youre passing Same goes for you miss he twinkled at Gi nny Well off you go off you go As he pushed past Harry into the darkening corridor Zabini shot him a filthy look that Ha rry returned with interest He Ginny and Neville followed Za bini back along the train Im glad thats over muttered Neville Strange man isnt he Yeah he is a bit said Harry his eyes on Zabini How come you ended up in there Ginny He saw me hex Zacharias Smith said Ginny You remember that idiot from Hufflepuff who was in the DA He kept on and on asking about what happened at the Ministry and in the end he annoyed me so much I hexed him when Slughorn came in I CHAPTER SEVEN 148 thought I was going to get detention but he just thought it was a really good hex and invited me to lunch Mad eh Better reason for inviting someone than because their mothers famous said Harry scowling at th e back of Zabinis head or because their uncle But he broke off An idea had just occurred to him a reckless but potentially wonderful idea In a minutes time Zabini was going to reenter the Slytherin si xthyear compartment and Malfoy would be sitting there thinking himself unheard by anybody except fellow Slytherins If Harry could only enter unseen behind him what might he not see or hear True there was little of the journey left Hogsmeade Statio n had to be less than half an hour away judging by the wildness of the scenery flashing by the windows but nobody else seemed prepared to take Harrys suspicions seriously so it wa s down to him to prove them Ill see you two later said Harry under his breath pulling out his Invisibility Cloak and flinging it over himself But whatre you asked Neville Later whispered Harry darting after Zabini as quietly as possible though the rattling of th e train made such caution almost pointless The corridors were almost completely empty now Nearly everyone had returned to th eir carriages to change into their school robes and pack up their possessions Though he was as close as he could get to Zabini without to uching him Harry was not quick enough to slip into the compar tment when Zabini opened the door Zabini was already sliding it shut when Harry hastily stuck out his foot to prevent it closing THE SLUG CLUB 149 Whats wrong with this thing said Zabini angrily as he smashed the sliding door repe atedly into Harrys foot Harry seized the door and pushed it open hard Zabini still clinging on to the handle toppled over sideways into Gregory Goyles lap and in the ensuing ruckus Harry darted into the compartment leapt onto Zabinis te mporarily empty seat and hoisted himself up into the luggage rack It was fortunate that Goyle and Zabini were snarling at each othe r drawing all eyes onto them for Harry was quite sure his feet and ankles had been revealed as the cloak had flapped around them indeed for one horrible moment he thought he saw Malfoys eyes follow his trainer as it whipped upward out of sight But then Goyl e slammed the door shut and flung Zabini off him Zabini collapsed in to his own seat looking ruffled Vincent Crabbe returned to his comic and Malfoy sniggering lay back down across two seats with his head in Pansy Parkinsons lap Harry lay curled uncomfortably un der the cloak to ensure that every inch of him remained hidde n and watched Pansy stroke the sleek blond hair off Malfoys fore head smirking as she did so as t h o u g h a n y o n e w o u l d h a v e l o v e d t o h a v e b e e n i n h e r p l a c e T h e lanterns swinging from the carriage ceiling cast a bright light over the scene Harry could read every wo rd of Crabbes comic directly below him So Zabini said Malfoy what did Slughorn want Just trying to make up to wellconnected people said Zabini who was still glowering at Goyle Not that he managed to find many This information did not seem to please Malfoy Who else had he invited he demanded CHAPTER SEVEN 150 McLaggen from Gryffindor said Zabini Oh yeah his uncles big in the Ministry said Malfoy someone else called Belby from Ravenclaw Not him hes a prat said Pansy and Longbottom Potter and that Weasley girl finished Zabini Malfoy sat up very suddenly kn ocking Pansys hand aside He invited Longbottom Well I assume so as Longbo ttom was there said Zabini indifferently Whats Longbottom got to interest Slughorn Zabini shrugged Potter precious Potter obvi ously he wanted a look at the Chosen One sneered Malfoy but that We asley girl Whats so special about her A lot of boys like her said Pa nsy watching Malfoy out of the corner of her eyes for his reaction Even you think shes goodlooking dont you Blaise and we all know how hard you are to please I wouldnt touch a filthy littl e blood traitor like her whatever she looked like said Zabini co ldly and Pansy looked pleased Malfoy sank back across her lap and allowed her to resume the stroking of his hair Well I pity Slughorns taste Maybe hes going a bit senile Shame my father always said he was a good wizard in his day My father used to be a bit of a favorite of his Slughorn probably hasnt heard Im on the train or I wouldnt bank on an invitati on said Zabini He asked me about Notts father when I first a r r i v e d T h e y u s e d t o b e o l d THE SLUG CLUB 151 friends apparently but when he heard hed been caught at the Ministry he didnt look happy an d Nott didnt get an invitation did he I dont think Slughorns interested in Death Eaters Malfoy looked angry but forc ed out a singularly humorless laugh Well who cares what hes interested in What is he when you come down to it Just some stupid teacher Malfoy yawned ostentatiously I mean I might not even be at Hogwarts next year whats it matter to me if some fat old hasbeen li kes me or not What do you mean you might not be at Hogwarts next year said Pansy indignantly ceasin g grooming Malf oy at once Well you never know said Malf oy with the ghost of a smirk I might have er moved on to bigger and better things Crouched in the luggage rack un der his cloak Harrys heart began to race What would Ron and Hermione say about this Crabbe and Goyle were gawping at Malfoy apparently they had had no inkling of any plans to move on to bigger and better things Even Zabini had allowed a look of curiosity to mar his haughty features Pansy resumed the slow stro king of Malfoys hair looking dumbfounded Do you mean Him Malfoy shrugged Mother wants me to complete my education but personally I dont see it as that im portant these days I mean think about it When the Dark Lord takes over is he going to care how many OWLs or NEWTs anyones got Of course he isnt Itll be all about the kind of service he receiv ed the level of devotion he was shown And you think youll be able to do something for him asked CHAPTER SEVEN 152 Zabini scathingly Sixteen years old and not even fully qualified yet Ive just said havent I Maybe he doesnt care if Im qualified Maybe the job he wants me to do isnt something that you need to be qualified for sa id Malfoy quietly Crabbe and Goyle were both sitting with their mouths open like gargoyles Pansy was gazing down at Malfoy as though she had never seen anything so aweinspiring I can see Hogwarts said Malf oy clearly relishing the effect he had created as he pointed out of the blackened window Wed better get our robes on Harry was so busy staring at Ma lfoy he did not notice Goyle reaching up for his trunk as he swung it down it hit Harry hard on the side of the head He let ou t an involuntary gasp of pain and Malfoy looked up at th e luggage rack frowning Harry was not afraid of Malfoy but he still did not much like the idea of being discovered hiding under his Invisibility Cloak by a group of unfriendly Slytherins Ey es still watering and head still throbbing he drew his wand care ful not to disarrange the cloak and waited breath held To his reli ef Malfoy seemed to decide that he had imagined the noise he pulled on his robes like the others locked his trunk and as the train slowed to a jerky crawl fastened a thick new traveling cloak round his neck Harry could see the corridors fill ing up again and hoped that Hermione and Ron would take his things out onto the platform for him he was stuck where he was until the compartment had quite emptied At last with a fina l lurch the train came to a complete halt Goyle threw the door open and muscled his way out THE SLUG CLUB 153 into a crowd of second years pu nching them aside Crabbe and Zabini followed You go on Malfoy told Pans y who was waiting for him with her hand held out as though hoping he would hold it I just want to check something Pansy left Now Harry and Malfoy were alone in the compartment People were filing past de scending onto the dark platform Malfoy moved over to the co mpartment door and let down the blinds so that people in the corridor beyond could not peer in He then bent down over his trunk and opened it again Harry peered down over the edge of the luggage rack his heart pumping a little faster What ha d Malfoy wanted to hide from Pansy Was he about to see the my sterious broken object it was so important to mend Petrificus Totalus Without warning Malfoy pointed his wand at Harry who was instantly paralyzed As though in slow motion he toppled out of the luggage rack and fell with an agonizing floorshaking crash at Malfoys feet the Invisibility Cloak trapped beneath him his whole body revealed with his legs still curled absurdly into the cramped kneeling position He coul dnt move a muscle he could only gaze up at Malfoy who smiled broadly I thought so he said jubilantly I heard Goyles trunk hit you And I thought I saw something white flash through the air after Zabini came back His eyes lingered for a mome nt upon Harrys trainers You didnt hear anything I care about Potter But while Ive got you here CHAPTER SEVEN 154 And he stamped hard on Harrys face Harry felt his nose break blood spurted everywhere Thats from my father Now lets see Malfoy dragged the cloak out from under Harrys immobilized body and threw it over him I dont reckon theyll find you ti ll the trains back in London he said quietly See you ar ound Potter or not And taking care to tread on Ha rrys fingers Malfoy left the compartment E I G H T 155 SNAPE VICTORIOUS arry could not move a muscle He lay there beneath the Invisibility Cloak feeling th e blood from his nose flow hot and wet over his face listenin g to the voices and footsteps in the corridor beyond His immediat e thought was that someone surely would check the compartments before the train departed again But at once came the disp iriting realization that even if somebody looked into the compartm ent he would be neither seen nor heard His best hope was th at somebody else would walk in and step on him Harry had never hated Malfoy more th an as he lay there like an absurd turtle on its back blood dr ipping sickeningly into his open mouth What a stupid situation to have landed himself in and now the last few footsteps were dying away everyone was shuffling along the dark platform outside he could hear the scraping of trunks and the loud babble of talk Ron and Hermione would think that he had left the train H CHAPTER EIGHT 156 without them Once they arrived at Hogwarts and took their places in the Great Hall looked up an d down the Gryffindor table a few times and finally realized that he was not there he no doubt would be halfway back to London He tried to make a sound even a grunt but it was impossible Then he remembered that some wi zards like Dumbledore could perform spells without speaking so he tried to summon his wand which had fallen out of his hand by saying the words Accio Wand over and over again in hi s head but nothing happened He thought he could hear the rustling of the trees that surrounded the lake and the faroff hoot of an owl but no hint of a search being made or even he despised himself slightly for hoping it panicked voices wondering where Harry Potter had gone A feeling of hopelessness spread thro ugh him as he imagined the convoy of thestraldrawn carriages tr undling up to the school and the muffled yells of laughter issuin g from whichever carriage Malfoy was riding in where he could be recounting his attack on Harry to Crabbe Goyle Zabini and Pansy Parkinson The train lurched causing Harry to roll over onto his side Now he was staring at the du sty underside of the seat s instead of the ceiling The floor began to vibrate as the engine roared into life The Express was leaving an d nobody knew he wa s still on it Then he felt his Invisibility Cl oak fly off him and a voice overhead said Wotcher Harry There was a flash of red light an d Harrys body unfroze he was able to push himself into a more dignified sitting position hastily wipe the blood off his bruised face with the back of his hand and raise his head to look up at Tonk s who was holding the Invisibility Cloak she had just pulled away SNAPE VICTORIOUS 157 Wed better get out of here quic kly she said as the train windows became obscured with steam and they began to move out of the station Come on well jump Harry hurried after her into the corridor She pulled open the train door and leapt onto the platfo rm which seemed to be sliding underneath them as the train gathered momentum He followed her staggered a little on landing then straightened up in time to see the gleaming scarlet steam engine pick up speed round the corner and disappear from view The cold night air was soothing on his throbbing nose Tonks was looking at him he felt angry and embarrassed th at he had been discovered in such a ridiculous position Silently she handed him back the Invisibility Cloak Who did it Draco Malfoy said Harry bitterl y Thanks for well No problem said Tonks with out smiling From what Harry could see in the darkness she wa s as mousyhaired and miserablelooking as she had been when he had met her at the Burrow I can fix your nose if you stand still Harry did not think much of this idea he had been intending to visit Madam Pomfrey the matron in whom he had a little more confidence when it came to Healing Spells but it seemed rude to say this so he stayed stockstill and closed his eyes Episkey said Tonks Harrys nose felt very hot and th en very cold He raised a hand and felt it gingerly It seemed to be mended Thanks a lot Youd better put that cloak back on and we can walk up to the school said Tonks still unsmilin g As Harry swung the cloak back CHAPTER EIGHT 158 over himself she waved her wand an immense silvery fourlegged creature erupted from it and streaked off into the darkness Was that a Patronus asked Harry who had seen Dumbledore send messages like this Yes Im sending word to the castle that Ive got you or theyll worry Come on wed better not dawdle They set off toward the lane that led to the school How did you find me I noticed you hadnt left the train and I knew you had that cloak I thought you might be hid ing for some reason When I saw the blinds were drawn down on that compartment I thought Id check But what are you doing he re anyway Harry asked Im stationed in Hogsmeade now to give the school extra protection said Tonks Is it just you whos stationed up here or No Proudfoot Savage an d Dawlish are here too Dawlish that Auror Dumbledore attacked last year Thats right They trudged up the dark desert ed lane following the freshly made carriage tracks Harry looked sideways at Tonks under his cloak Last year she had been inquis itive to the point of being a little annoying at times she had laughed easily she had made jokes Now she seemed older and much more serious and purposeful Was this all the effect of what ha d happened at the Ministry He reflected uncomfortably that Hermio ne would have suggested he say something consoling about Sirius to h e r t h a t i t h a d n t b e e n h e r fault at all but he co uldnt bring himself to do it He was far from blaming her for Siriuss death it was no more her fault than anyone SNAPE VICTORIOUS 159 elses and much less than his but he did not like talking about Sirius if he could avoid it And so they tramped on through the cold night in silence Tonkss long cloak whispering on the ground behind them Having always traveled there by carriage Harry had never before appreciated just how far Hogwarts was from Hogsmeade Station With great relief he finally saw the tall pillars on either side of the gates each topped with a winged boar He was cold he was hungry and he was quite keen to le ave this new gloomy Tonks behind But when he put out a hand to push open the gates he found them chained shut Alohomora he said confidently pointing his wand at the padlock but nothing happened That wont work on these said Tonks Dumbledore bewitched them himself Harry looked around I could climb a wall he suggested No you couldnt said Tonks flat ly Antiintruder jinxes on all of them Securitys been tightened a hundredfold this summer Well then said Harry starting to feel annoyed at her lack of helpfulness I suppose Ill just ha ve to sleep out here and wait for morning Someones coming down for you said Tonks Look A lantern was bobbing at the dist ant foot of the castle Harry was so pleased to see it he felt he could even endure Filchs wheezy criticisms of his tardiness and rants about how his timekeeping would improve with the regular applicat ion of thumbscrews It was not until the glowing yellow ligh t was ten feet away from them and Harry had pulled off his Invisibi lity Cloak so that he could be CHAPTER EIGHT 160 seen that he recognized with a rush of pure loathing the uplit hooked nose and long black gr easy hair of Severus Snape Well well well sneered Snape taking out his wand and tapping the padlock once so that the chains snaked backward and the gates creaked open Nice of you to turn up Potter although you have evidently decided that the we aring of school robes would detract from your appearance I couldnt change I didnt have my Harry began but Snape cut across him There is no need to wait Nymphadora Potter is quite ah safe in my hands I meant Hagrid to get the me ssage said Tonks frowning Hagrid was late for the startofterm feast just like Potter here so I took it instead And incidentally said Snape standing back to allow Harry to pass him I was interested to see your new Patronus He shut the gates in her face with a loud clang and tapped the chains with his wand again so th at they slithered clinking back into place I think you were better off with the old one said Snape the malice in his voice unmistakab le The new one looks weak As Snape swung the lantern about Harry saw fleetingly a look of shock and anger on Tonkss face Then she was covered in darkness once more Good night Harry called to her ov er his shoulder as he began the walk up to the scho ol with Snape Thanks for everything See you Harry Snape did not speak for a minute or so Harry felt as though his body was generating waves of hatred so powerful that it seemed SNAPE VICTORIOUS 161 incredible that Snape could not feel them burning him He had loathed Snape from their first encounter but Snape had placed himself forever and irrevocably beyo nd the possibility of Harrys forgiveness by his attitude toward Sirius Whatever Dumbledore said Harry had had time to think over the summer and had concluded that Snapes snide remarks to Sirius about remaining safely hidden while the rest of the Order of th e Phoenix were off fighting Voldemort had probably been a powerful factor in Sirius rushing off to the Ministry the night that he had died Harry clung to this notion because it enabled him to blame Sn ape which felt satisfying and also because he knew that if anyone was not sorry that Sirius was dead it was the man now striding next to him in the darkness Fifty points from Gryffindor for lateness I think said Snape And let me see another twenty for your Muggle attire You know I dont believe any House has ever b een in negative figures this early in the term We havent even star ted pudding You might have set a record Potter The fury and hatred bubbling inside Harry seemed to blaze whitehot but he would rather have been immobilized all the way back to London than tell Snape why he was late I suppose you wanted to make an entrance did you Snape continued And with no flying car available you decided that bursting into the Great Hall halfway through the feast ought to create a dramatic effect Still Harry remained silent thou gh he thought his chest might explode He knew that Snape had come to fetch him for this for the few minutes when he could needle and torment Harry without anyone else listening They reached the castle steps at last and as the great oaken front CHAPTER EIGHT 162 doors swung open into the vast flagge d entrance hall a burst of talk and laughter and of tinkling plates and glasses greeted them through the doors standing open into the Great Hall Harry wondered whether he could slip his In visibility Cloak back on thereby gaining his seat at the long Gr yffindor table which inconveniently was the farthest from the entrance hall without being noticed As though he had read Harrys mind however Snape said N o c l o a k Y o u c a n w a l k i n s o t h a t e v e r y o n e s e e s y o u w h i c h i s what you wanted Im sure Harry turned on the spot and marched straight through the open doors anything to get away from Snape The Great Hall with its four long House tables an d its staff table set at the top of the room was decorated as usual wi th floating candles that made the plates below glitter and glow It was all a shimmering blur to Harry however who walked so fa st that he was passing the Hufflepuff table before people really started to stare and by the time they were standing up to get a good look at him he had spotted Ron and Hermione sped along the benches toward them and forced his way in between them Whereve you blimey whatve you done to your face said Ron goggling at him along with everyone else in the vicinity Why whats wrong with it sa id Harry grabbing a spoon and squinting at his distorted reflection Youre covered in blood said Hermione Come here She raised her wand said Tergeo and siphoned off the dried blood Thanks said Harry feeling his now clean face Hows my nose looking SNAPE VICTORIOUS 163 Normal said Hermione anxiously Why shouldnt it Harry what happened Wev e been terrified Ill tell you later said Harry cu rtly He was very conscious that Ginny Neville Dean and Seamus were listening in even Nearly Headless Nick the Gryffindor ghos t had come floating along the bench to eavesdrop But said Hermione Not now Hermione said Harry in a darkly sign ificant voice He hoped very much that they would all assume he had been involved in something heroic prefer ably involving a couple of Death Eaters and a dementor Of course Malfoy would spread the story as far and wide as he could but there was always a chance it wouldnt reach too many Gr yffindor ears He reached across Ron for a coup le of chicken legs and a handful of chips but before he could ta ke them they vanished to be replaced with puddings You missed the Sorting anyway said Hermione as Ron dived for a large chocolate gateau Hat say anything interesting asked Harry taking a piece of treacle tart More of the same really advi sing us all to unite in the face of our enemies you know Dumbledore mentioned Voldemort at all Not yet but he always saves his proper speech for after the feast doesnt he It cant be long now Snape said Hagrid was late for the feast Youve seen Snape How come said Ron between frenzied mouthfuls of gateau CHAPTER EIGHT 164 Bumped into him said Harry evasively Hagrid was only a few minutes late said Hermione Look hes waving at you Harry Harry looked up at the staff ta ble and grinned at Hagrid who was indeed waving at him Hagrid had never quite managed to comport himself with the dignity of Profes sor McGonagall Head of Gryffindor House the top of whose head came up to somewhere between Hagrids elbow and shoulder as they were sitting side by side and who was lookin g disapprovingly at this enthusiastic greeting Harry was surprised to see th e Divination teacher Professor Trelawney sitting on Hagrids othe r side she rarely left her tower room and he had never seen her at the startofterm feast before She looked as odd as ever glittering with beads and trailing shawls her eyes magnified to enormous size by her spectacles Having always considered her a bit of a fraud Harry had been shocked to discover at the end of the previous term that it had been she who had made the predicti on that caused Lord Voldemort to kill Harrys parents and attack Harry himself The knowledge had made him even less eager to find himself in her company but thankfully this year he would be dropping Divina tion Her great beaconlike eyes swiveled in his dire ction he hastily looked away toward the Slytherin table Draco Ma lfoy was miming the shattering of a nose to raucous laughter an d applause Harry dropped his gaze to his treacle tart his insides bu rning again What he would not give to fight Malfoy oneonone So what did Profes sor Slughorn want Hermione asked To know what really happened at the Mi nistry said Harry Him and everyone else here sniffed Hermione People were interrogating us about it on the train werent they Ron SNAPE VICTORIOUS 165 Yeah said Ron All wanting to know if you really are the Chosen One There has been much talk on that very subject even amongst the ghosts interrupted Nearly Headless Nick inclining his barely connected head toward Harry so that it wobbled dangerously on its ruff I am considered something of a Potter authority it is widely known that we are friendly I have assured the spirit community that I will not pester you for info rmation however Harry Potter knows that he can confide in me wi th complete confidence I told them I would rather die than betray his trust Thats not saying much seeing as youre already dead Ron observed Once again you show all the sensitivity of a blunt axe said Nearly Headless Nick in affronted tones and he rose into the air and glided back toward the far end of the Gryffindor table just as Dumbledore got to his feet at the st aff table The talk and laughter echoing around the Hall died away almost instantly The very best of evenings to yo u he said smiling broadly his arms opened wide as though to embrace the whole room What happened to his ha nd gasped Hermione She was not the only one who had noticed Dumbledores right hand was as blackened and deadl ooking as it had been on the night he had come to fetch Harry from the Dursleys Whispers swept the room Dumbledore interp reting them correctly merely smiled and shook his purpleand gold sleeve over his injury Nothing to worry about he said airily Now to our new students welcome to our old students welcome back Another year full of magical educ ation awaits you His hand was like that wh en I saw him over the summer CHAPTER EIGHT 166 Harry whispered to Hermione I thought hed have cured it by now though or Mada m Pomfrey wouldve done It looks as if its died said Hermione with a nauseated expression But there are some injuries you cant cure old curses and there are poisons wi thout antidotes and Mr Filch our caretaker has asked me to say that there is a blanket ban on any joke items bought at the shop called Weasleys Wiza rd Wheezes Those wishing to play for thei r House Quidditch teams should give their names to their Heads of House as usual We are also looking for new Quidditch commenta tors who should do likewise We are pleased to welcome a new member of staff this year Professor Slughorn Slughorn st ood up his bald head gleaming in the candlelight his big waistcoated belly casting the table below into shadow is a former colleague of mine who has agreed to resume his old post of Potions master Potions Potions The word echoed all over the Ha ll as people wondered whether they had heard right Potions said Ron and Hermione together turning to stare at Harry But you said Professor Snape meanwhile said Dumbledore raising his voice so that it carried over all th e muttering will be taking over the position of Defense Agai nst the Dark Arts teacher No said Harry so loudly that many heads turned in his direction He did not care he was starin g up at the staff table incensed How could Snape be given the Defen se Against the Dark Arts job SNAPE VICTORIOUS 167 after all this time Hadnt it been widely known for years that Dumbledore did not trust him to do it But Harry you said that Slugho rn was going to be teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts said Hermione I thought he was said Harry racking his brains to remember when Dumbledore had told him this but now that he came to think of it he was unable to recall Dumbledore ever telling him what Slughorn would be teaching Snape who was sitting on Dumble dores right did not stand up at the mention of his name he merely raised a hand in lazy acknowledgment of the applause fr om the Slytherin table yet Harry was sure he could detect a look of triumph on the features he loathed so much Well theres one good thing he said savagely Snapell be gone by the end of the year What do you mean asked Ron That jobs jinxed No o nes lasted more than a year Quirrell actually died doing it Person ally Im going to keep my fingers crossed for another death Harry said Hermione shocked and reproachful He might just go back to teaching Potions at the end of the year said Ron reasonably Tha t Slughorn bloke might not want to stay longterm Moody didnt Dumbledore cleared his throat Harry Ron and Hermione were not the only ones who had been ta lking the whole Hall had erupted in a buzz of conversation at the news that Snape had finally achieved his hearts desire Seemingly oblivi ous to the sensational nature of the news he had just imparted Du mbledore said nothing more CHAPTER EIGHT 168 about staff appointments but wait ed a few seconds to ensure that the silence was absolute before continuing Now as everybody in this Hall knows Lord Voldemort and his followers are once more at la rge and gaining in strength The silence seemed to tauten an d strain as Dumbledore spoke Harry glanced at Malfoy Malfoy was not looking at Dumbledore but making his fork hover in midair with his wand as though he found the headmasters words unworthy of his attention I cannot emphasize strongly enough how dangerous the present situation is and how much care each of us at Hogwarts must take to ensure that we remain safe Th e castles magical fortifications have been strengthened over the summer we are protected in new and more powerful ways but we must still guard scrupulously against carelessness on the part of any student or member of staff I urge you therefore to abide by any security restrictions that your teachers might impose upon you however irksome you might find them in particular the rule that you are not to be out of bed after hours I implore you should you notice anything strange or suspicious within or outside the cast le to report it to a member of staff immediately I trust you to conduct yourselves always with the utmost regard for your own and others safety Dumbledores blue eyes swept over the students before he smiled once more But now your beds await as warm and comfortable as you could possibly wish and I know that your top priority is to be wellrested for your lessons tomorrow Let us therefore say good night Pip pip With the usual deafening scraping noise the benches were moved back and the hundreds of st udents began to file out of the SNAPE VICTORIOUS 169 Great Hall toward their dormitori es Harry who wa s in no hurry at all to leave with the gawping crowd nor to get near enough to Malfoy to allow him to retell the story of the nosestamping lagged behind pretending to retie the lace on his trainer allowing most of the Gryffindors to draw ahead of him Hermione had darted ahead to fulfill her prefects duty of sh epherding the first years but Ron remained with Harry What really happened to your nose he asked once they were at the very back of the throng pre ssing out of the Hall and out of earshot of anyone else Harry told him It was a mark of th e strength of their friendship that Ron did not laugh I saw Malfoy miming something to do with a nose he said darkly Yeah well never mind that said Harry bitterly Listen to what he was saying before he found out I was there Harry had expected Ron to be stunned by Malfoys boasts With what Harry considered pure pigheadedness however Ron was unimpressed Come on Harry he was just sh owing off for Parkinson What kind of mission would Yo uKnowWho have given him How dyou know Voldemort do esnt need someone at Hogwarts It wouldnt be the first I wish yehd stop sayin tha name Harry said a reproachful voice behind them Harry looked over his shoulder to see Hagrid shaking his head Dumbledore uses that name said Harry stubbornly Yeah well thas Dumbledore innit said Hagrid mysteriously So how come yeh were late Harry I was worried CHAPTER EIGHT 170 Got held up on the train said Harry Why were you late I was with Grawp said Hagrid happily Los track o the time Hes got a new home up in the mountains now Dumbledore fixed it nice big cave Hes much ha ppier than he was in the forest We were havin a good chat Really said Harry taking care not to catch Rons eye the last time he had met Hagrids halfbrother a vicious giant with a talent for ripping up trees by the roots his vocabulary had comprised five words two of which he was un able to pronounce properly Oh yeah hes really come on said Hagrid proudly Yehll be amazed Im thinkin o trainin him up as me assistant Ron snorted loudly but managed to pass it off as a violent sneeze They were now standing beside the oa k front doors Anyway Ill see yeh tomorrow firs lessons straight after lunch Come early an yeh can say hello ter Buck I mean Witherwings Raising an arm in cheery farewell he headed out of the front doors into the darkness Harry and Ron looked at each ot her Harry could tell that Ron was experiencing the same si nking feeling as himself Youre not taking Care of Magical Creature s are you Ron shook his head And yo ure not either are you Harry shook his head too And Hermione said Ron shes not is she Harry shook his head again Ex actly what Hagrid would say when he realized his three favori te students had given up his subject he did not like to think N I N E 171 THE HALFBLOOD PRINCE arry and Ron met Hermione in the common room before breakfast next morning Hoping for some support for his theory Harry lost no time in telling Hermione what he had overheard Malfoy saying on the Hogwarts Express But he was obviously showing off for Parkinson wasnt he interjected Ron quickly before Hermione could say anything Well she said uncertai nly I dont know It would be like Malfoy to make himself seem more important than he is but thats a big lie to tell Exactly said Harry but he co uld not press the point because so many people were trying to li sten in to his conversation not to mention staring at him and whispering behind their hands Its rude to point Ron snapped at a particularly minuscule firstyear boy as they joined the queue to climb out of the portrait hole The boy who had been muttering something about Harry H CHAPTER NINE 172 behind his hand to his friend pr omptly turned scarlet and toppled out of the hole in al arm Ron sniggered I love being a sixth year And were going to be getting free time this year Whole periods when we can just sit up here and relax Were going to need that time for studying Ron said Hermione as they set off down the corridor Yeah but not today said Ron T odays going to be a real doss I reckon Hold it said Hermione thro wing out an arm and halting a passing fourth year who was attemp ting to push past her with a limegreen disk clutched tightly in his hand Fanged Frisbees are banned hand it over she told him sternly The scowling boy handed over the snarling Frisbee ducked under her arm and took off after his friends Ron waited for him to vanish then tugged the Frisbee from Hermiones grip Excellent Ive always wanted one of these Hermiones remonstration was dr owned by a loud giggle Lavender Brown had apparently found Ro ns remark highly amusing She continued to laugh as she passed them glancing back at Ron over her shoulder Ron looked rath er pleased with himself The ceiling of the Great Hall wa s serenely blue and streaked with frail wispy clouds just like the squares of sk y visible through the high mullioned windows While they tucked into porridge and eggs and bacon Harry and Ron to ld Hermione about their embarrassing conversation with Hagrid the previous evening But he cant really think wed continue Care of Magical Creatures she said looking distressed I mean when has any of us expressed you know any enthusiasm Thats it though innit said Ron swallowing an entire fried THE HALFBLOOD PRINCE 173 egg whole We were the ones who made the most effort in classes because we like Hagrid But he thinks we liked the stupid subject Dyou reckon anyones going to go on to NEWT Neither Harry nor Hermione an swered there was no need They knew perfectly well that nobody in their year would want to continue Care of Magical Creatu res They avoided Hagrids eye and returned his cheery wave only halfheartedly when he left the staff table ten minutes later After they had eaten they rema ined in their places awaiting Professor McGonagalls descent from the staff table The distribution of class schedules was more complicated than usual this year for Professor McGonagall needed first to confirm that everybody had achieved the necessary OWL grades to continue with their chosen NEWTs Hermione was immediately cleared to continue with Charms Defense Against the Dark Arts Transfiguration Herbology Arithmancy Ancient Runes and Poti ons and shot off to a firstperiod Ancient Runes cla ss without further ado Neville took a little longer to sort out his roun d face was anxious as Professor McGonagall looked down his appl ication and then consulted his OWL results Herbology fine she said Profe ssor Sprout will be delighted to see you back with an Outstan ding OWL And you qualify for Defense Against the Dark Arts with Exceeds Expectations But the problem is Transfiguration Im sorry Longbottom but an Acceptable really isnt good enough to continue to NEWT level I just dont think you d be able to cope with the coursework Neville hung his head Professo r McGonagall peered at him through her square spectacles CHAPTER NINE 174 Why do you want to continue with Transfiguration anyway Ive never had the impr ession that you particularly enjoyed it Neville looked miserable and muttered something about my grandmother wants Hmph snorted Professor McGonagall Its high time your grandmother learned to be proud of the grands on shes got rather than the one she thinks she ough t to have particularly after what happened at the Ministry Neville turned very pink and blinked confusedly Professor McGonagall had never paid him a compliment before Im sorry Longbottom but I ca nnot let you into my NEWT class I see that you have an Exceeds Expectations in Charms however why not try for a NEWT in Charms My grandmother thinks Charms is a soft option mumbled Neville Take Charms said Professor McGonagall and I shall drop Augusta a line reminding her that just because she failed her Charms OWL the subject is not necessarily worthless Smiling slightly at the look of delighted in credulity on Nevilles face Professor McGonagall tapped a blank sche dule with the tip of her wand and handed it now carrying detail s of his new classes to Neville Professor McGonagall turned next to Parvati Patil whose first question was whether Firenze th e handsome centaur was still teaching Divination He and Professor Trelawney are dividing classes between them this year said Professor McGona gall a hint of disapproval in her voice it was common knowledge th at she despised the subject of Divination The sixth year is being taken by Professor Trelawney THE HALFBLOOD PRINCE 175 Parvati set off for Divination five minutes later looking slightly crestfallen So Potter Potter said Professor McGonagall consulting her notes as she turned to Ha rry Charms Defense Against the Dark Arts Herbology Transfiguratio n all fine I must say I was pleased with your Transfiguration mark Potter very pleased Now why havent you applied to continue with Potions I thought it was your ambition to become an Auror It was but you told me I had to get an Outstanding in my OWL Professor And so you did when Professor Snape was teaching the subject Professor Slughorn however is pe rfectly happy to accept NEWT students with Exceeds Expectatio ns at OWL Do you wish to proceed with Potions Yes said Harry but I didnt buy the books or any ingredients or anything Im sure Professor Slughorn will be able to lend you some said Professor McGonagall Very well Potter here is your schedule Oh by the way twenty hopefuls have already put down their names for the Gryffindor Quidditc h team I shall pa ss the list to you in due course and you can fix up trials at your leisure A few minutes later Ron was cleared to do the same subjects as Harry and the two of them left the table together Look said Ron delightedly gazing at his schedule weve got a free period now and a free period after brea k and after lunch excellent They returned to the common room which was empty apart from a half dozen seventh years including Katie Bell the only CHAPTER NINE 176 remaining member of the original Gryffindor Quidditch team that Harry had joined in his first year I thought youd get th at well done she called over pointing at the Captains badge on Harrys chest Tell me when you call trials Dont be stupid said Harry you dont need to try out Ive watched you play for five years You mustnt start off like that she said warningly For all you know theres someone much better than me out there Good teams have been ruined before now beca use Captains just kept playing the old faces or letting in their friends Ron looked a little uncomfortable and began playing with the Fanged Frisbee Hermione had take n from the fourthyear student It zoomed around the common room snarling and attempting to take bites of the tapestry Crookshan kss yellow eyes followed it and he hissed when it came too close An hour later they reluctantly left the sunlit common room for the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom four floors below Hermione was already queuing outside carrying an armful of heavy books and looking putupon We got so much homework for Runes she said anxiously when Harry and Ron joined her A fifteeninch essay two translations and Ive got to read these by Wednesday Shame yawned Ron You wait she said resentfully I bet Snape gives us loads The classroom door opened as she spoke and Snape stepped into the corridor his sallow face fram ed as ever by two curtains of greasy black hair Silence fell over the queue immediately Inside he said THE HALFBLOOD PRINCE 177 Harry looked around as they entered Snape had imposed his personality upon the room already it was gloomier than usual as curtains had been drawn over the windows and was lit by candlelight New pictures adorned the walls many of them showing people who appeared to be in pain spor ting grisly injuries or strangely contorted body parts Nobody spok e as they settled down looking around at the shadowy gruesome pictures I have not asked you to take ou t your books said Snape closing the door and moving to face the class from behind his desk Hermione hastily dropped her copy of Confronting the Faceless back into her bag and stowed it under her chair I wish to speak to you and I want your fullest attention His black eyes roved over their upturned faces lingering for a fraction of a second longer on Harrys than anyone elses You have had five teachers in this subject so far I believe You believe like you havent watched them all come and go Snape hoping youd be next thought Harry scathingly Naturally these teachers will all have had their own methods and priorities Given this confusio n I am surprised so many of you scraped an OWL in this subject I shall be even more surprised if all of you manage to keep up wi th the NEWT work which will be much more advanced Snape set off around the edge of the room speaking now in a lower voice the class craned th eir necks to keep him in view The Dark Arts said Snape a re many varied everchanging and eternal Fighting them is like fighting a manyheaded monster which each time a neck is severed sprouts a head even fiercer and cleverer than before You are fighti ng that which is unfixed mutating indestructible CHAPTER NINE 178 H a r r y s t a r e d a t S n a p e I t w a s s u r e l y o n e t h i n g t o r e s p e c t t h e Dark Arts as a dangerous enemy another to speak of them as Snape was doing with a lovi ng caress in his voice Your defenses said Snape a lit tle louder must therefore be as flexible and inventive as the arts you seek to undo These pictures he indicated a few of them as he swept past give a fair representation of what happens to those who suffer for instance the Cruciatus Curse he waved a hand toward a witch who was clearly shrieking in agony feel the Dementors Kiss a wizard lying huddled and blankeyed slumped against a wall or provoke the aggression of the I nferius a bloody mass upon the ground Has an Inferius been seen then said Parvati Pa til in a highpitched voice Is it definite is he using them The Dark Lord has used Inferi in the past said Snape which means you would be welladvised to assume he might use them again Now He set off again around the othe r side of the classroom toward his desk and again they watched him as he walked his dark robes billowing behind him you are I believe complete novices in the use of nonverbal spells What is the advant age of a nonverbal spell Hermiones hand shot into the ai r Snape took his time looking around at everybody else making sure he had no choice before saying curtly Very well Miss Granger Your adversary has no warning about what kind of magic youre about to perform said Hermione which gives you a splitsecond advantage An answer copied almost word for word from The Standard Book THE HALFBLOOD PRINCE 179 of Spells Grade Six said Snape dismissively over in the corner Malfoy sniggered but correct in essentials Yes those who progress to using magic without shouting incantations gain an element of surprise in their spellcasting No t all wizards can do this of course it is a question of concentration and mind power which some his gaze lingered maliciously up on Harry once more lack Harry knew Snape was thinking of their disastrous Occlumency lessons of the previous year He refused to drop his gaze but glowered at Snape until Snape looked away You will now divide Snape went on into pairs One partner will attempt to jinx the other without speaking The other will attempt to repel the jinx in equal silence Carry on Although Snape did not know it Harry had taught at least half the class everyone who had been a member of the DA how to perform a Shield Charm the previous year None of them had ever cast the charm without speaking ho wever A reasonable amount of cheating ensued many people were merely whispering the incantation instead of saying it al oud Typically ten minutes into the lesson Hermione managed to repel Nevilles muttered JellyLegs Jinx without uttering a single word a feat that would surely have earned her twenty points for Gryffindor from any reasonable teacher thought Harry bitterly but which Snape ignored He swept between them as they practiced looking just as much like an overgrown bat as ever lingering to watch Harry and Ron struggling with the task Ron who was supposed to be ji nxing Harry was purple in the face his lips tightly compressed to save himself from the temptation of muttering the incantation Ha rry had his wand raised waiting on tenterhooks to repel a jinx that seemed unlikely ever to come CHAPTER NINE 180 Pathetic Weasley said Snape after a while Here let me show you He turned his wand on Harry so fast that Harry reacted instinctively all thought of nonverbal spells forgotten he yelled Protego His Shield Charm was so strong Snape was knocked offbalance and hit a desk The whole clas s had looked around and now watched as Snape righte d himself scowling Do you remember me telling you we are practicing nonverbal spells Potter Yes said Harry stiffly Yes sir Theres no need to call me sir Professor The words had escaped him before he knew what he was saying Several people gasped including Hermione Behind Snape however Ron Dean and Seamus grinned appreciatively Detention Saturday night my office said Snape I do not take cheek from anyone Potter not even the Chosen One That was brilliant Ha rry chortled Ron once they were safely on their way to break a short while later You really shouldnt have said it said Hermione frowning at Ron What made you He tried to jinx me in case yo u didnt notice fumed Harry I had enough of that during those Occlumency lessons Why doesnt he use another guinea pig for a ch ange Whats Dumbledore playing at anyway letting him teach D efense Did you hear him talking about the Dark Arts He loves them All that unfixed indestructible stuff Well said Hermione I though t he sounded a bit like you Like me THE HALFBLOOD PRINCE 181 Yes when you were telling us what its like to face Voldemort You said it wasnt just memorizing a bunch of spells you said it was just you and your brains and your guts well wasnt that what Snape was saying That it really comes down to being brave and quickthinking Harry was so disarmed that she had thought his words as well worth memorizing as The Standard Book of Spells that he did not argue Harry Hey Harry Harry looked around Jack Sloper one of the Beaters on last years Gryffindor Quidditch team was hurrying toward him holding a roll of parchment For you panted Sloper List en I heard youre the new Captain Whenre you holding trials Im not sure yet said Harry thinking privately that Sloper would be very lucky to get back on the team Ill let you know Oh right I was hoping itd be this weekend But Harry was not listening he ha d just recognized the thin slanting writing on the parchment Leaving Sloper in midsentence he hurried away with Ron and He rmione unrolling the parchment as he went Dear Harry I would like to start our private lessons this Saturday Kindly come along to my office at 8 PM I hope you are enjoying your first day back at school Yours sincerely Albus Dumbledore P S I enjoy Acid Pops CHAPTER NINE 182 He enjoys Acid Pops said Ron who had read the message over Harrys shoulder and was looking perplexed Its the password to get past the gargoyle outside his study said Harry in a low voice Ha Snapes not going to be pleased I wont be able to do his detention He Ron and Hermione spent th e whole of break speculating on what Dumbledore would teach Harry Ron thought it most likely to be spectacular jinxes and hexes of the type the Death Eaters would not know Hermione said such things were illegal and thought it much more likely that Dumbledore wanted to teach Harry advanced Defensive magic After break she went off to Arithmancy while Harry and Ron returned to the common room where they grudgingly started Snapes homework This turned out to be so complex that they stil l had not finished when Hermione joined them for their afterlunch free period though she considerably speeded up the process They had only just finished when the bell rang for the afternoons doubl e Potions and they beat the familiar path down to the dungeon cl assroom that had for so long been Snapes When they arrived in the corridor they saw that there were only a dozen people progressing to NE WT level Crabbe and Goyle had evidently failed to achieve the required OWL grade but four Slytherins had made it through includin g Malfoy Four Ravenclaws were there and one Huff lepuff Ernie Macmillan whom Harry liked despite his rather pompous manner Harry Ernie said portentously holding out his hand as Harry approached didnt get a chance to speak in Defense Against the Dark Arts this morning Good le sson I thought but Shield THE HALFBLOOD PRINCE 183 Charms are old hat of course for us old DA lags And how are you Ron Hermione Before they could say more than fine the dungeon door opened and Slughorns belly preced ed him out of the door As they filed into the room his great wa lrus mustache curved above his beaming mouth and he greeted Ha rry and Zabini with particular enthusiasm The dungeon was most unusually already full of vapors and odd smells Harry Ron and Hermio ne sniffed interestedly as they passed large bubbling cauldrons The four Slytherins took a table together as did the four Ravenc laws This left Harry Ron and Hermione to share a table with Ernie They chose the one nearest a goldcolored cauldron that was em itting one of the most seductive scents Harry had ever inhaled So mehow it reminded him simultaneously of treacle tart the woody smell of a broomstick handle and something flowery he thought he might have smelled at the Burrow He found that he was br eathing very slow ly and deeply and that the potions fumes seemed to be filling him up like drink A great contentment stole over him he grinned across at Ron who grinned back lazily Now then now then now then said Slughorn whose massive outline was quivering through the many shimmering vapors Scales out everyone and potion ki ts and dont forget your copies of Advanced PotionMaking Sir said Harry raising his hand Harry mboy I havent got a book or scales or anything nors Ron we didnt realize wed be able to do the NEWT you see CHAPTER NINE 184 Ah yes Professor McGonagall did mention not to worry my dear boy not to worry at all You can use ingredients from the store cupboard today and Im sure we can lend you some scales and weve got a small stock of ol d books here theyll do until you can write to Flourish and Blotts Slughorn strode over to a corner cupboard and after a moments foraging emerged with two very batteredlooking copies of Advanced PotionMaking by Libatius Borage which he gave to Harry and Ron along with two se ts of tarnished scales Now then said Slughorn returning to the front of the class and inflating his already bulging ch est so that the buttons on his waistcoat threatened to burst off Ive prepared a few potions for you to have a look at just out of interest you know These are the kind of thing you ought to be able to make after completing your NEWTs You ought to have he ard of em even if you havent made em yet Anyone tell me what this one is He indicated the cauldron neare st the Slytherin table Harry raised himself slightly in his seat and saw what looked like plain water boiling away inside it Hermiones wellpracticed hand hit the air before anybody elses Slughorn pointed at her Its Veritaserum a colorless odorless potion that forces the drinker to tell the tr uth said Hermione Very good very good said Slughorn happily Now he continued pointing at the cauldron nearest the Ravenclaw table this one here is pretty well known Featured in a few Ministry leaflets lately too Who can Hermiones hand was fastest once more THE HALFBLOOD PRINCE 185 Its Polyjuice Potion sir she said Harry too had recognized the slow bubbling mudlike substance in the second cauldron but did not resent Hermione getting the credit for answering the question she after all was the one who had succeeded in making it back in their second year Excellent excellent Now this one here yes my dear said Slughorn now looking slightly bemused as Hermiones hand punched the air again Its Amortentia It is indeed It seems almost foolish to ask said Slughorn who was looking mightily impressed b ut I assume you know what it does Its the most powerful love potion in the world said Hermione Quite right You recognized it I suppose by its distinctive motherofpearl sheen And the steam rising in characte ristic spirals said Hermione enthusiastically and it s supposed to smell di fferently to each of us according to what attracts us and I can smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and But she turned slightly pink and did not complete the sentence May I ask your name my dear said Slughorn ignoring Hermiones embarrassment Hermione Granger sir Granger Granger Can you po ssibly be related to Hector DagworthGranger who founded th e Most Extraordinary Society of Potioneers No I dont think so sir Im Muggleborn you see Harry saw Malfoy lean close to Nott and whisper something CHAPTER NINE 186 both of them sniggered but Slug horn showed no dismay on the contrary he beamed and looked from Hermione to Harry who was sitting next to her Oho One of my best friends is Muggl eborn and shes the best in our year Im assuming this is the ve ry friend of whom you spoke Harry Yes sir said Harry Well well take twenty wellearned points for Gryffindor Miss Granger said Slughorn genially Malfoy looked rather as he had done the time Hermione had punched him in the face Hermione turned to Harry with a radiant expression and whispered Did you really tell him Im the best in the year Oh Harry Well whats so impressive about that whispered Ron who for some reason looked annoyed You are the best in the year Idve told him so if hed asked me Hermione smiled but made a shhing gesture so that they could hear what Slughorn was saying Ro n looked slightly disgruntled Amortentia doesnt really create love of course It is impossible to manufacture or imitate love No this will simply cause a powerful infatuation or obsession It is probably the most dangerous and powerful potion in this room oh yes he said nodding gravely at Malfoy and Nott both of wh om were smirking skeptically W h e n y o u h a v e s e e n a s m u c h o f l i f e a s I h a v e y o u w i l l n o t u n derestimate the power of obsessive love And now said Slughorn it is time for us to start work Sir you havent told us whats in this one said Ernie Macmillan pointing at a small black ca uldron standing on Slughorns desk The potion within was spla shing about merrily it was the THE HALFBLOOD PRINCE 187 color of molten gold and large drops were leaping like goldfish above the surface though not a particle had spilled Oho said Slughorn again Harry was sure that Slughorn had not forgotten the potion at all but had waited to be asked for dramatic effect Yes That Well that one ladies and gentlemen is a most curious little potion called Feli x Felicis I take it he turned smiling to look at Hermione who had let out an audible gasp that you know what Felix Fe licis does Miss Granger Its liquid luck said Hermione excitedly It makes you lucky The whole class seemed to sit up a little straighten Now all Harry could see of Malfoy was the back of his sleek blond head because he was at last giving Slughorn his full and undivided attention Quite right take another ten points for Gryffindor Yes its a funny little potion Felix Felici s said Slughorn Desperately tricky to make and disastrous to get wrong However if brewed correctly as this has been you will find that all your endeavors tend to succeed at least un til the effects wear off Why dont people drink it all the time sir said Terry Boot eagerly Because if taken in excess it causes giddiness recklessness and dangerous overconfidence said Slughorn Too much of a good thing you know highly toxi c in large quantities But taken sparingly and very occasionally Have you ever taken it sir asked Michael Corner with great interest Twice in my life said Slughorn Once when I was twentyfour once when I was fiftyseven Two tablespoonfuls taken with breakfast Two perfect days CHAPTER NINE 188 He gazed dreamily into the dist ance Whether he was playacting or not thought Harry the effect was good And that said Slughorn apparently coming back to earth is what I shall be offering as a prize in this lesson There was silence in which eve ry bubble and gurgle of the surrounding potions seemed magnified tenfold One tiny bottle of Felix Felici s said Slughorn taking a minuscule glass bottle with a cork in it out of his pocket and showing it to them all Enough for twelve hours luck From dawn till dusk you will be lucky in everything you attempt Now I must give you warning that Felix Felicis is a banned substance in organized competitions sporting events for instance examinations or elections So the wi nner is to use it on an ordinary day only and watch how that ordinary day becomes extraordinary So said Slughorn suddenly br isk how are you to win my fabulous prize Well by turning to page ten of Advanced PotionMaking We have a little over an hour left to us which should be time for you to make a decent at tempt at the Draught of Living Death I know it is more comp lex than anything you have attempted before and I do not expe ct a perfect potion from anybody The person who does best however will win little Felix here Off you go There was a scraping as everyo ne drew their cauldrons toward t h e m a n d s o m e l o u d c l u n k s a s p e o p l e b e g a n a d d i n g w e i g h t s t o their scales but nobody spoke Th e concentration within the room was almost tangible Harry saw Malf oy riffling feverishly through his copy of Advanced PotionMaking It could not have been clearer THE HALFBLOOD PRINCE 189 that Malfoy really wanted that lucky day Harry bent swiftly over the tattered book Sl ughorn had lent him To his annoyance he saw that th e previous owner had scribbled all over the pages so that the margins were as black as the printed portions Bending low to decipher the ingredients even here the previous owner had made annota tions and crossed things out Harry hurried off toward the stor e cupboard to find what he needed As he dashed back to his cauldron he saw Malfoy cutting up valerian roots as fast as he could Everyone kept glancing around at what the rest of the class was doing this was both an advantage and a disadvantage of Potions that it was hard to keep your work private Within ten minutes the whole place was full of bluish steam Hermione of course seemed to have progressed furthest He r potion already resembled the smooth black currantcolored liquid mentioned as the ideal halfway stage Having finished chopping his roots Harry bent low over his book again It was really very irri tating having to try and decipher the directions under all the stupid scribbles of the previous owner who for some reason had taken issu e with the order to cut up the sopophorous bean and had written in the alternative instruction Crush with flat side of silver dagger releases juice better than cutting Sir I think you knew my gr andfather Abraxas Malfoy Harry looked up Slughorn was just passing the Slytherin table Yes said Slughorn without look ing at Malfoy I was sorry to CHAPTER NINE 190 hear he had died although of cour se it wasnt unexpected dragon pox at his age And he walked away Harry bent back over his cauldron smirking He could tell that Malfoy had expected to be treated like Harry or Zabini perhaps even hoped fo r some preferential treatment of the type he had learned to expect from Snape It looked as though Malfoy would have to re ly on nothing but talent to win the bottle of Felix Felicis The sopophorous bean was proving very difficult to cut up Harry turned to Hermione Can I borrow your silver knife She nodded impatiently not taking her eyes off her potion which was still deep purple though according to the book ought to be turning a light shade of lilac by now Harry crushed his bean with the flat side of the dagger To his astonishment it immediately exuded so much juice he was amazed the shriveled bean could have held it all Hastily scooping it all into the cauldron he saw to his surprise that the potion immediately turned exactly the shade of li lac described by the textbook His annoyance with the previous owner vanishing on the spot Harry now squinted at the next line of instructions According to the book he had to stir counterc lockwise until the potion turned clear as water Accord ing to the addition the previous owner had made however he ought to add a clockwise stir after every seventh counterclockwise stir Could th e old owner be right twice Harry stirred counterclockwise held his breath and stirred once clockwise The effect was immediat e The potion turned palest pink How are you doing that de manded Hermione who was redTHE HALFBLOOD PRINCE 191 faced and whose hair was growing bushier and bushier in the fumes from her cauldron her potion was still resolutely purple Add a clockwise stir No no the book says counterclockwise she snapped Harry shrugged and continued what he was doing Seven stirs counterclockwise one clockwise pause seven stirs counterclockwise one stir clockwise Across the table Ron was cursing fluently under his breath his potion looked like liquid licori ce Harry glanced around As far as he could see no one elses potion had turned as pale as his He felt elated something that had certainl y never happened before in this dungeon And times up called Sl ughorn Stop stirring please Slughorn moved slowly among th e tables peering into cauldrons He made no comment but occasionally gave the potions a stir or a sniff At last he reac hed the table where Harry Ron Hermione and Ernie were sitting He smiled ruefully at the tarlike substance in Rons cauldron He passed over Ernies navy concoction Hermiones potion he gave an approving nod Then he saw Harrys and a look of incredulou s delight spread over his face The clear winner he cried to the dungeon Excellent excellent Harry Good lord its clear yo uve inherited your mothers talent She was a dab hand at Potions Lily was Here you are then here you are one bottle of Felix Felicis as promised and use it well Harry slipped the tiny bottle of golden liquid into his inner pocket feeling an odd combination of delight at the furious looks on the Slytherins faces and guilt at the disappointed expression on Hermiones Ron looked simply dumbfounded CHAPTER NINE 192 How did you do that he whispe red to Harry as they left the dungeon Got lucky I suppose said Ha rry because Malfoy was within earshot Once they were securely ensconc ed at the Gryffindor table for dinner however he felt safe enough to tell them Hermiones face became stonier with ev ery word he uttered I spose you think I cheated he finished aggravated by her expression Well it wasnt exactly your own work was it she said stiffly He only followed different instru ctions to ours said Ron Couldve been a catastrophe couldnt it But he took a risk and it paid off He heaved a sigh Slu ghorn couldve handed me that book but no I get the one no ones ever written on Puked on by the look of page fiftytwo but Hang on said a voice close by Harrys left ear and he caught a sudden waft of that flowery smell he had picked up in Slughorns dungeon He looked around and saw that Ginny had joined them Did I hear right Youve been taking orders from something someone wrote in a book Harry She looked alarmed and angry Harry knew what was on her mind at once Its nothing he said reassuring ly lowering his voice Its not like you know Riddles diary Its just an old textbook someones scribbled on But youre doing what it says I just tried a few of the tips written in the margins honestly Ginny theres nothing funny Ginnys got a point said Hermione perking up at once We THE HALFBLOOD PRINCE 193 ought to check that theres noth ing odd about it I mean all these funny instructions who knows Hey said Harry indignantly as she pulled his copy of Advanced PotionMaking out of his bag an d raised her wand Specialis Revelio she said rapping it smartly on the front cover Nothing whatsoever happened The book simply lay there looking old and dirty and dogeared Finished said Harry irritably Or dyou want to wait and see if it does a few backflips It seems all right said Hermione still staring at the book suspiciously I mean it really does se em to be ju st a textbook Good Then Ill have it back said Harry snatching it off the table but it slipped from his ha nd and landed open on the floor Nobody else was lookin g Harry bent low to retrieve the book and as he did so he saw somet hing scribbled along the bottom of the back cover in the same small cramped handwriting as the instructions that had won him his bo ttle of Felix Felicis now safely hidden inside a pair of socks in his trunk upstairs This Book is the Property of the HalfBlood Prince T E N 194 THE HOUSE OF GAUNT or the rest of the weeks Potions lessons Harry continued to follow the HalfBlood Princes instructions wherever they deviated from Libatius Borages with the result that by their fourth lesson Slughorn was ravi ng about Harrys abilit i e s s a y i n g t h a t h e had rarely taught anyone so tale nted Neither Ron nor Hermione was delighted by this Although Harry had offered to share his book with both of them Ron had more difficulty deciphering the handwriting than Harry did and could not keep asking Harry to read aloud or it might look susp icious Hermione meanwhile was resolutely plowing on with what she called the official instructions but becoming increasingly badtempered as they yielded poorer results than the Princes Harry wondered vaguely who the HalfBlood Prince had been Although the amount of homework they had been given prevented him from reading the whole of his copy of Advanced PotionMaking he had skimmed through it sufficiently to see that there was barely F THE HOUSE OF GAUNT 195 a page on which the Prince had no t made additional notes not all of them concerned with potionmaking Here and there were directions for what looked like spells that the Prince had made up himself Or herself said Hermione irri tably overhearing Harry pointing some of these out to Ron in the common room on Saturday evening It might have been a girl I think the handwriting looks more like a girls than a boys The HalfBlood Prince he was called Harry said How many girls have been Princes Hermione seemed to have no answ er to this She merely scowled and twitched her essay on The Principles of Rematerialization away from Ron who was trying to read it upside down Harry looked at his watch and hu rriedly put the old copy of Advanced PotionMaking back into his bag Its five to eight Id better go Ill be late for Dumbledore Ooooh gasped Hermione looking up at once Good luck Well wait up we want to hear what he teaches you Hope it goes okay said Ron and the pair of them watched Harry leave through the portrait hole Harry proceeded through deserted corridors though he had to step hastily behind a statue wh en Professor Trelawney appeared around a corner muttering to hers elf as she shuffled a pack of dirtylooking playing cards reading them as she walked Two of spades conflict she murmured as she passed the place where Harry crouched hidden Seven of spades an ill omen Ten of spades violence Knave of sp ades a dark young man possibly troubled one who dislik es the questioner She stopped dead right on the other side of Harrys statue CHAPTER TEN 196 Well that cant be right sh e said annoyed and Harry heard her reshuffling vigorously as she set off again le aving nothing but a whiff of cooking sherry behind her Harry waited until he was quite sure she had gone then hurrie d off again until he reached the spot in the seventhfloor corridor where a single gargoyle stood against the wall Acid Pops said Harry and the gargoyle leapt aside the wall behind it slid apart and a moving spiral stone staircase was revealed onto which Harry stepped so that he was carried in smooth circles up to the door with the br ass knocker that led to Dumbledores office Harry knocked Come in said Dumbledores voice Good evening sir said Harry wa lking into the headmasters office Ah good evening Harry Sit down said Dumbledore smiling I hope youve had an enjoya ble first week back at school Yes thanks sir said Harry You must have been busy a dete ntion under your belt already Er began Harry awkwardly bu t Dumbledore did not look too stern I have arranged with Professor Snape that you will do your detention next Saturday instead Right said Harry who had more pressing matters on his mind than Snapes detention and now looked around surreptitiously for some indication of what Du mbledore was planni ng to do with him this evening The ci rcular office looked just as it always did the delicate silver instruments sto od on spindlelegged tables puffing smoke and whirring portrait s of previous headmasters and THE HOUSE OF GAUNT 197 headmistresses dozed in their frames and Dumbledores magnificent phoenix Fawkes stood on his perch behind the door watching Harry with bright interest It did not even look as though Dumbledore had cleared a sp ace for dueling practice So Harry said Dumbledore in a businesslike voice You have been wondering I am sure what I have planned for you during these for want of a better word lessons Yes sir Well I have decided that it is time now that you know what prompted Lord Voldemort to try an d kill you fifteen years ago for you to be given ce rtain information There was a pause You said at the end of last te rm you were going to tell me everything said Harry It was hard to keep a note of accusation from his voice Sir he added And so I did said Dumbledore pl acidly I told you everything I know From this point forth we shall be leaving the firm foundation of fact and journeying together through the murky marshes of memory into thickets of wildest guesswork From here on in Harry I may be as woefully wrong as Humphrey Belcher who believed the time was ripe for a cheese cauldron But you think youre right said Harry Naturally I do but as I have al ready proven to yo u I make mistakes like the next man In fact being forgive me rather cleverer than most men my mistak es tend to be correspondingly huger Sir said Harry tentatively doe s what youre go ing to tell me have anything to do with the pr ophecy Will it help me survive CHAPTER TEN 198 It has a very great deal to do with the prophecy said Dumbledore as casually as if Harry ha d asked him about the next days weather and I certainl y hope that it will help you to survive Dumbledore got to his feet and wa lked around the desk past Harry who turned eagerly in his seat to watch Dumbledore bending over the cabinet beside the door When Dumbledore straightened up he was holding a familiar shallow stone basin etched with odd markings around its rim He plac ed the Pensieve on the desk in front of Harry You look worried Harry had indeed been eyeing the Pensieve with some apprehension His previous experiences with the odd device that stored and revealed thoughts and memori es though highly instructive had also been uncomfortable The last time he had disturbed its contents he had seen much more than he would have wished But Dumbledore was smiling This time you enter the Pensieve with me and even more unusually with permission Where are we going sir For a trip down Bob Ogdens memory lane said Dumbledore pulling from his pocket a crysta l bottle containing a swirling silverywhite substance Who was Bob Ogden He was employed by the Department of Magical Law Enforcement said Dumbledore He died some time ago but not before I had tracked him down and persua ded him to confide these recollections to me We are about to accompany him on a visit he made in the course of his duties If you will stand Harry THE HOUSE OF GAUNT 199 But Dumbledore was having difficulty pulling out the stopper of the crystal bottle His injured ha nd seemed stiff and painful Shall shall I sir No matter Harry Dumbledore pointed his wand at the bottle and the cork flew out Sir how did you injure your hand Harry asked again looking at the blackened fingers with a mixture of revulsion and pity Now is not the moment for that story Harry Not yet We have an appointment with Bob Ogden Dumbledore tipped the silvery contents of the bottle into the Pensieve where they swirled and shimmered neither liquid nor gas After you said Dumbledore gesturing toward the bowl Harry bent forward took a deep breath and plunged his face into the silvery substance He felt his feet leave the office floor he was falling falling through whirling darkness and then quite suddenly he was blinking in dazzli ng sunlight Before his eyes had adjusted Dumbledore la nded beside him They were standing in a count ry lane bordered by high tangled hedgerows beneath a summer sky as bright and blue as a forgetmenot Some ten feet in front of them stood a short plump man wearing enormously thick glasses that reduced his eyes to molelike specks He was reading a wooden sign post that was sticking out of the brambles on the lefthand side of the road Harry knew this must be Ogden he was the only pe rson in sight and he was also wearing the strange assortment of clothes so often chosen by inexperienced wizards trying to look like Muggles in this case a frock coat and spats over a striped onepiece bathing costume Before CHAPTER TEN 200 Harry had time to do more than register his bizarre appearance however Ogden had se t off at a brisk walk down the lane Dumbledore and Harry followed As they passed the wooden sign Harry looked up at its two arms The one pointing back the way they had come read Great Hangleton 5 miles The arm pointing after Ogden said Little Hangleton 1 mile They walked a short way with nothing to see but the hedgerows the wide blue sky overhead and th e swishing frockcoated figure a h e a d T h e n t h e l a n e c u r v e d t o the left and fell away sloping steeply down a hillside so that th ey had a sudden unexpected view of a whole valley laid out in fron t of them Harry could see a village undoubtedly Littl e Hangleton nestle d between two steep hills its church and graveyard clea rly visible Across the valley set on the opposite hillside was a handsome manor house surrounded by a wide expanse of velvety green lawn Ogden had broken into a reluctan t trot due to the steep downward slope Dumbledore lengthened his stride and Harry hurried to keep up He thought Little Ha ngleton must be their final destination and wondered as he had done on the night they had found S l u g h o r n w h y t h e y h a d t o a p p r o a c h i t f r o m s u c h a d i s t a n c e H e soon discovered that he was mist aken in thinking that they were going to the village however The lane curved to the right and when they rounded the corner it was to see the very edge of Ogdens frock coat vanishing th rough a gap in the hedge Dumbledore and Harry followed him onto a narrow dirt track bordered by higher and wilder hedg erows than those they had left behind The path was crooked ro cky and potholed sloping downhill like the last one an d it seemed to be heading for a patch of dark trees a little below them Sure enough the track soon opened up THE HOUSE OF GAUNT 201 at the copse and Dumbledore and Harry came to a halt behind Ogden who had stoppe d and drawn his wand Despite the cloudless sky the old trees ahead cast deep dark cool shadows and it was a few seconds before Harrys eyes discerned the building halfhidden amongst the tang le of trunks It seemed to him a very strange location to choose for a house or else an odd decision to leave the trees growing nearby blocking all light and the view of the valley below He wondered wh ether it was inhabited its walls were mossy and so many tiles had fa llen off the roof that the rafters were visible in places Nettles grew all around it their tips reaching the windows which were tiny and th ick with grime Just as he had concluded that nobody could possib ly live there however one of the windows was thrown open with a clatter and a thin trickle of steam or smoke issued from it as though somebody was cooking Ogden moved forward quietly and it seemed to Harry rather cautiously As the dark shadows of the trees slid over him he stopped again staring at the fr ont door to which somebody had nailed a dead snake Then there was a rustle and a crac k and a man in rags dropped from the nearest tree landing on his feet right in front of Ogden who leapt backward so fast he st ood on the tails of his frock coat and stumbled Youre not welcome The man standing before them had thick hair so matted with dirt it could have been any color Several of his teeth were missing His eyes were small and dark and stared in op posite directions He might have looked comical but he did not the effect was frightening and Harry could not blame Ogden for backing away several more paces before he spoke CHAPTER TEN 202 Er good morning Im from the Ministry of Magic Youre not welcome Er Im sorry I dont unde rstand you said Ogden nervously Harry thought Ogden was being extremely dim the stranger was making himself very clear in Harrys opinion particularly as he was brandishing a wand in one hand and a short and rather bloody knife in the other You understand him Im sure Harry said Dumbledore quietly Yes of course said Harry sl ightly nonplussed Why cant Ogden But as his eyes found the dead snake on the door again he suddenly understood Hes speaking Parseltongue Very good said Dumbledo re nodding and smiling The man in rags was now advancing on Ogden knife in one hand wand in the other Now look Ogden began bu t too late There was a bang and Ogden was on the ground cl utching his nose while a nasty yellowish goo squirted fr om between his fingers Morfin said a loud voice An elderly man had come hurrying out of the cottage banging the door behind him so that the dead snake swung pathetically This man was shorter than the fi rst and oddly proportioned his shoulders were very broad and his arms overlong which with his bright brown eyes short scrubby ha ir and wrinkled face gave him the look of a powerful aged monk ey He came to a halt beside the man with the knife who was now cackling with laughter at the sight of Ogden on the ground THE HOUSE OF GAUNT 203 Ministry is it said the ol der man looking down at Ogden Correct said Ogden angrily dabbing his face And you I take it are Mr Gaunt Sright said Gaunt Got you in the fa ce did he Yes he did snapped Ogden Shouldve made your presence known shouldnt you said Gaunt aggressively This is privat e property Cant just walk in here and not expect my son to defend himself Defend himself against what ma n said Ogden clambering back to his feet Busybodies Intruders Muggles and filth Ogden pointed his wand at his ow n nose which was still issuing large amounts of what looked like yellow pus and the flow stopped at once Mr Gaunt spoke out of the corner of his mouth to Morfin Get in the house Dont argue This time ready for it Harry recognized Parseltongue even while he could understand what was being said he distinguished the weird hissing noise that wa s all Ogden could hear Morfin seemed to be on the point of disa greeing but when his father cast him a threatening look he change d his mind lumbering away to the cottage with an odd rolling ga it and slamming the front door behind him so that the snake swung sadly again Its your son Im here to see Mr Gaunt said Ogden as he mopped the last of the pus from the front of his coat That was Morfin wasnt it Ar that was Morfin said th e old man indifferently Are you pureblood he asked suddenly aggressive Thats neither here nor there said Ogden coldly and Harry felt his respect for Ogden rise Apparently Gaunt felt rather CHAPTER TEN 204 differently He squinted into Ogd ens face and muttered in what was clearly supposed to be an offen sive tone Now I come to think about it Ive seen noses like yours down in the village I dont doubt it if your sons be en let loose on them said Ogden Perhaps we could contin ue this discussion inside Inside Yes Mr Gaunt Ive already to ld you Im here about Morfin We sent an owl Ive no use for owls said Gaunt I dont open letters Then you can hardly complain th at you get no warning of visitors said Ogden tartly I am he re following a serious breach of Wizarding law which occurred here in the early hours of this morning All right all right all right bellowed Gaunt Come in the bleeding house then and much good itll do you The house seemed to contain three tiny rooms Two doors led off the main room which served as kitchen and living room combined Morfin was sitting in a filt hy armchair beside the smoking fire twisting a live adder betw een his thick fingers and crooning softly at it in Parseltongue Hissy hissy little snakey Slither on the floor You be good to Morfin Or hell nail you to the door There was a scuffling noise in the corner beside the open window and Harry realized that there was somebody else in the room a girl whose ragged gray dress was the exact color of the dirty stone THE HOUSE OF GAUNT 205 wall behind her She was standing beside a steaming pot on a grimy black stove and was fiddling around with the shelf of squalidlooking pots and pans above it Her hair was lank and dull and she had a plain pale rather heavy fa ce Her eyes like her brothers stared in opposite directions She looked a little cleaner than the two men but Harry thought he had never seen a more defeatedlooking person Mdaughter Merope said Gaun t grudgingly as Ogden looked inquiringly toward her Good morning said Ogden She did not answer but with a fr ightened glance at her father turned her back on th e room and continued shifting the pots on the shelf behind her Well Mr Gaunt said Ogden t o get straight to the point we have reason to believe that your son Morfin performed magic in front of a Muggle late last night There was a deafening clang Me rope had dropped one of the pots Pick it up Gaunt bellowed at her Thats it grub on the floor like some filthy Muggle whats your wand for you useless sack of muck Mr Gaunt please said Ogden in a shocked voice as Merope who had already picked up the pot flushed blotchily scarlet lost her grip on the pot again drew her wand shakily from her pocket pointed it at the pot and muttered a hasty inaudible spell that caused the pot to shoot across the floor away from her hit the opposite wall and crack in two Morfin let out a mad cackle of laughter Gaunt screamed Mend it you pointles s lump mend it CHAPTER TEN 206 Merope stumbled across the room but before she had time to raise her wand Ogden had lifted his own and said firmly Reparo The pot mended itself instantly Gaunt looked for a moment as th ough he was going to shout at Ogden but seemed to think better of it Instead he jeered at his daughter Lucky the nice man fr om the Ministrys here isnt it Perhaps hell take you off my hand s perhaps he doesnt mind dirty Squibs Without looking at anybody or t h a n k i n g O g d e n M e r o p e picked up the pot and returned it hands trembling to its shelf She then stood quite still her back ag ainst the wall betw een the filthy window and the stove as though she wished for nothing more than to sink into the stone and vanish Mr Gaunt Ogden began again as Ive said the reason for my visit I heard you the first time snapped Gaunt And so what Morfin gave a Muggle a bit of what was coming to him what about it then Morfin has broken Wizarding law said Ogden sternly Morfin has broken Wizarding law Gaunt imitated Ogdens voice making it pompous and si ngsong Morfin cackled again He taught a filthy Muggle a lesso n thats illegal now is it Yes said Ogden Im afraid it is He pulled from an inside pocket a small scroll of parchment and unrolled it Whats that then his sentence said Gaunt his voice rising angrily It is a summons to the Ministry for a hearing THE HOUSE OF GAUNT 207 Summons Summons Who do you think you are summoning my son anywhere Im Head of the Magical Law E nforcement Squad said Ogden And you think were scum do yo u screamed Gaunt advancing on Ogden now with a dirty yell ownailed finger pointing at his chest Scum wholl come running when the Ministry tells em to Do you know who youre talking to you filthy little Mudblood do you I was under the impre ssion that I was speaking to Mr Gaunt said Ogden looking wary but standing his ground Thats right roared Gaunt For a moment Harry thought Gaunt was making an ob scene hand gesture bu t then realized that he was showing Ogden the ugly bl ackstoned ring he was wearing on his middle finger waving it before Ogdens eyes See this See this Know what it is Know where it came from Centuries its been in our family thats how fa r back we go and pureblood all the way Know how much Ive been offered for this with the Peverell coat of arms engraved on the stone Ive really no idea said Ogd en blinking as the ring sailed within an inch of his nose and its quite beside the point Mr Gaunt Your son has committed With a howl of rage Gaunt ran toward his daughter For a split second Harry thought he was going to throttle her as his hand flew to her throat next moment he wa s dragging her toward Ogden by a gold chain around her neck See this he bellowed at Ogden shaking a heavy gold locket at him while Merope spluttere d and gasped for breath I see it I see it said Ogden hastily CHAPTER TEN 208 Slytherins yelled Gaunt Salazar Slyt herins Were his last living descendants what do you say to that eh Mr Gaunt your daughter sa id Ogden in alarm but Gaunt had already released Merope she staggered away from him back to her corner massaging her neck and gulping for air So said Gaunt triumphantly as though he had just proved a complicated point beyond all possib le dispute Dont you go talking to us as if were dirt on yo ur shoes Generations of purebloods wizards all more than you can say I dont doubt And he spat on the floor at Og dens feet Morfin cackled again Merope huddled beside the window her head bowed and her face hidden by her lank hair said nothing Mr Gaunt said Ogden doggedly I am afraid that neither your ancestors nor mine have anyt hing to do with the matter in hand I am here because of Morf in Morfin and the Muggle he accosted late last night Our information he glanced down at his scroll of parchment is that Morf in performed a jinx or hex on the said Muggle causing him to erupt in highly painful hives Morfin giggled Be quiet boy snarled Gaunt in Parseltongue and Morfin fell silent again And so what if he did then Gaunt said defiantly to Ogden I expect youve wiped the Muggles fi lthy face clean for him and his memory to boot Thats hardly the point is it Mr Gaunt said Ogden This was an unprovoked attack on a defenseless Ar I had you marked out as a Mugglelover the moment I saw you sneered Gaunt and he spat on the floor again This discussion is getting us no where said Ogden firmly It is THE HOUSE OF GAUNT 209 clear from your sons attitude that he feels no remorse for his actions He glanced down at his sc roll of parchment again Morfin will attend a hearing on the fourteenth of September to answer the charges of using magic in front of a Muggle and causing harm and distress to that same Mugg Ogden broke off The jingling clopping sounds of horses and loud laughing voices were drif ting in through the open window Apparently the winding lane to the village passed very close to the copse where the house stood Gaunt froze listening his eyes wide Morfin hissed and turned his face toward the sounds his expression hungry Merope raised her head Her face Harry saw was starkly white My God what an eyesore rang out a girls voice as clearly audible through the open window as if she had stood in the room beside them Couldnt your father have that hovel cleared away Tom Its not ours said a young mans voice Everything on the other side of the valley belongs to us but that cottage belongs to an old tramp called Gaunt and his ch ildren The sons quite mad you should hear some of the storie s they tell in the village The girl laughed The jingling clopping noises were growing louder and louder Morfin made to get out of his armchair Keep your seat said his father warnin gly in Parseltongue Tom said the girls voice again now so close they were clearly right beside the house I migh t be wrong but has somebody nailed a snake to that door Good lord youre right said the mans voice Thatll be the son I told you hes not right in th e head Dont look at it Cecilia darling CHAPTER TEN 210 The jingling and clopping soun ds were now growing fainter again Darling whispered Morfin in Parseltongue looking at his sister Darling he called her So he wo uldnt have you anyway Merope was so white Harry felt sure she was going to faint Whats that said Gaunt sharply also in Parseltongue looking from his son to his daughter What did you say Morfin She likes looking at that Muggle said Morfin a vicious expression on his face as he stared at his sister who now looked terrified Always in the garden when he pa sses peering through the hedge at him isnt she And last night Merope shook her head jerkily im ploringly but Morfin went on ruthlessly Hanging out of the window waiting for him to ride home wasnt she Hanging out of the window to look at a Muggle said Gaunt quietly All three of the Gaunts seemed to have forgotten Ogden who was looking both bewildered and i rritated at this renewed outbreak of incomprehensible hissing and rasping Is it true said Gaunt in a deadly vo ice advancing a step or two toward the terrified girl My daughter pureblooded descendant of Salazar Slytherin hankering after a filthy dirtveined Muggle Merope shook her head frantically pressing herself into the wall apparently unable to speak But I got him Father cackled Morfin I got him as he went by and he didnt look so pretty with hives all over hi m did he Merope You disgusting little Squib yo u filthy little blood traitor roared Gaunt losing control and his ha nds closed around his daughters throat THE HOUSE OF GAUNT 211 Both Harry and Ogden yelled N o at the same time Ogden raised his wand and cried Relashio Gaunt was thrown backward away from his daughter he tripped over a chair and fell flat on his back With a roar of rage Morfin leapt out of his chair and ran at Ogden brandishing his bloody kni fe and firing hexes indiscriminately from his wand Ogden ran for his life Dumbledore indicated that they ought to follow and Harry obeyed Meropes screams echoin g in his ears Ogden hurtled up the path and er upted onto the main lane his arms over his head where he coll ided with the glossy chestnut horse ridden by a very handsome da rkhaired young man Both he and the pretty girl riding beside him on a gray horse roared with laughter at the sight of Ogden who bounced off the horses flank and set off again his frock coat flying covered from head to foot in dust running pellm ell up the lane I think that will do Harry said Dumbledore He took Harry by the elbow and tugged Next moment they were both soaring weightlessly through darkness until they landed squarely on their feet back in Dumbledore s now twilit office What happened to the girl in th e cottage said Harry at once as Dumbledore lit extra lamps with a flick of his wand Merope or whatever her name was Oh she survived said Dumble dore reseating himself behind his desk and indicating that Ha rry should sit down too Ogden Apparated back to the Ministry an d returned with reinforcements within fifteen minutes Morfin and his father attempted to fight but both were overpowered remo ved from the cottage and subsequently convicted by the Wizengamot Morfin who already had a record of Muggle attacks was sent enced to three years in Azkaban CHAPTER TEN 212 Marvolo who had injure d several Ministry em ployees in addition to Ogden received six months Marvolo Harry repe ated wonderingly Thats right said Dumbledore sm iling in approval I am glad to see youre keeping up That old man was Voldemorts grandfather yes said Dumbledore Marvolo his son Morfin and his daughter Merope were th e last of the Gaunts a very ancient Wizarding fa mily noted for a vein of instability and violence that flourished through the generations due to their habit of marrying their own cousins Lack of sense coupled with a great liking for grandeur meant that the family gold was squandered several ge nerations before Marv olo was born He as you saw was left in squalor and poverty with a very nasty temper a fantastic amount of arrogance an d pride and a couple of family heirlooms that he treasured just as much as his son and rather more than his daughter So Merope said Harry leaning forward in his chair and staring at Dumbledore so Merope wa s Sir does that mean she was Voldemorts mother It does said Dumbledore And it so happens that we also had a glimpse of Voldemorts father I wonder whether you noticed The Muggle Morfin attacked The man on the horse Very good indeed said Dumble dore beaming Yes that was Tom Riddle senior the handsome Muggle who used to go riding past the Gaunt cottage and for whom Merope Gaunt cherished a secret burning passion And they ended up ma rried Harry said in di sbelief unable to imagine two people less likely to fall in love THE HOUSE OF GAUNT 213 I think you are forgetting said Dumbledore that Merope was a witch I do not believe that her magical powers appeared to their best advantage when she was being terrorized by her father Once Marvolo and Morfin were sa fely in Azkaban once she was alone and free for the first time in her life then I am sure she was able to give full rein to her abilit ies and to plot her escape from the desperate life she had le d for eighteen years Can you not think of any measure Merope could have taken to make Tom Riddle forget his Muggle companion and fall in love with her instead The Imperius Curse Harry su ggested Or a lo ve potion Very good Personally I am incl ined to think th at she used a love potion I am sure it would have seemed more romantic to her and I do not think it would have b een very difficult some hot day when Riddle was riding alone to pe rsuade him to take a drink of water In any case within a few mo nths of the scene we have just witnessed the village of Little Hangleton enjoyed a tremendous scandal You can imagine the gossip it caused when the squires son ran off with the tram ps daughter Merope But the villagers shock was nothing to Marvolos He returned from Azkaban expecting to find hi s daughter dutifully awaiting his return with a hot meal ready on hi s table Instead he found a clear inch of dust and her note of fare well explaining wh at she had done From all that I have been able to discover he never mentioned her name or existence from that time forth The shock of her desertion may have contributed to his early death or perhaps he had simply never learned to feed himself Azkaban had greatly weakened Marvolo and he did not live to see Morfin return to the cottage CHAPTER TEN 214 And Merope She she died didnt she Wasnt Voldemort brought up in an orphanage Yes indeed said Dumbledore We must do a certain amount of guessing here although I do no t think it is difficult to deduce what happened You see within a few months of their runaway marriage Tom Riddle reappeared at the manor house in Little Hangleton without his wife The rumor flew around the neighborhood that he was talking of bein g hoodwinked and taken in What he meant I am sure is th at he had been under an enchantment that had now lifted though I daresay he did not dare use those precise words for fear of being thought insane When they heard what he was saying howeve r the villagers guessed that Merope had lied to Tom Riddle pretending that she was going to have his baby and that he had married her for this reason But she did have his baby But not until a year after they were married Tom Riddle left her while she was still pregnant What went wrong asked Harry Why did the love potion stop working Again this is guesswork said Dumbledore but I believe that Merope who was deeply in love wi th her husband could not bear to continue enslaving him by ma gical means I believe that she made the choice to st op giving him the poti on Perhaps besotted as she was she had convinced hers elf that he would by now have fallen in love with her in return Perhaps she thought he would stay for the babys sake If so she was wrong on both counts He left her never saw her again and never troubl ed to discover what became of his son THE HOUSE OF GAUNT 215 The sky outside was inky black and the lamps in Dumbledores office seemed to glow more brightly than before I think that will do for tonight Harry said Dumbledore after a moment or two Yes sir said Harry He got to his feet but did not leave Sir is it important to know all this about Voldemorts past Very important I think said Dumbledore And it its got someth ing to do with the prophecy It has everything to do with the prophecy Right said Harry a little confused but reassured all the same He turned to go then another question occurred to him and he turned back again Sir am I al lowed to tell Ron and Hermione everything youve told me Dumbledore considered him for a moment then said Yes I think Mr Weasley and Miss Granger have proved themselves trustworthy But Harry I am going to as k you to ask them not to repeat any of this to anybody else It wo uld not be a good id ea if word got around how much I know or suspect about Lord Voldemorts secrets No sir Ill make sure its just Ron and Hermione Good night He turned away again and was almost at the door when he saw it Sitting on one of the little sp indlelegged tables that supported so many fraillooking silver instru ments was an ugly gold ring set with a large cracked black stone Sir said Harry staring at it That ring Yes said Dumbledore CHAPTER TEN 216 You were wearing it when we visited Professor Slughorn that night So I was Dumbledore agreed But isnt it sir isnt it the same ring Marvolo Gaunt showed Ogden Dumbledore bowed his head The very same But how come Have you always had it No I acquired it very recently said Dumbledore A few days before I came to fetch you from yo ur aunt and uncles in fact That would be around the time you injured your hand then sir Around that time yes Harry Harry hesitated Dumb ledore was smiling Sir how exactly Too late Harry You shall hear the story another time Good night Good night sir E L E V E N 217 HERMIONES HELPING HAND s Hermione had predicted the sixth years free periods were not the hours of blissful relaxation Ron had anticipated but times in which to attempt to keep up with the vast amount of homework they were being set Not only were they studying as though they had exam s every day but the lessons themselves had become more demandin g than ever before Harry barely understood half of what Professor McGonagall said to them these days even Hermione had had to ask her to repeat instructions once or twice Incredibly and to He rmiones increasing resentment Harrys best subject had suddenly be come Potions thanks to the HalfBlood Prince Nonverbal spells were now ex pected not only in Defense Against the Dark Arts but in Charms and Transfiguration too Harry frequently looked over at his classmates in the common room or at mealtimes to see them purple in the face and straining as though they had overdosed on UNoPoo but he knew that they A CHAPTER ELEVEN 218 were really struggling to make spells work without saying incantations aloud It was a relief to get outside into the greenhouses they were dealing with more dangerous plants than ever in Herbology but at least they were still allowe d to swear loudly if the Venomous Tentacula seized them un expectedly from behind One result of their enormous wor kload and the frantic hours of practicing nonverbal spells was that Harry Ron and Hermione had so far been unable to find time to go and visit Hagrid He had stopped coming to meals at the sta ff table an ominous sign and on the few occasions when they had pa ssed him in the corridors or out in the grounds he had mysteriously failed to notice them or hear their greetings Weve got to go and explain said Hermione looking up at Hagrids huge empty chair at the staff table the following Saturday at breakfast Weve got Quidditch tryouts this morning said Ron And were supposed to be practici ng that Aguamenti Charm from Flitwick Anyway explain what Ho w are we going to tell him we hated his stupid subject We didnt hate it said Hermione Speak for yourself I havent fo rgotten the skrewts said Ron darkly And Im telling you now weve had a narrow escape You didnt hear him going on about his gormless brother wed have been teaching Grawp how to tie his shoelaces if wed stayed I hate not talking to Hagrid said Hermione looking upset Well go down after Quidditch Harry assured her He too was missing Hagrid although like Ron he thought that they were better off without Grawp in their lives But trials might take all morning the number of people wh o have applied He felt slightly HERMIONES HELPING HAND 219 nervous at confronting the first hu rdle of his Captaincy I dunno why the teams this popular all of a sudden Oh come on Harry said Herm ione suddenly impatient Its not Quidditch thats popular its you Youve never been more interesting and frankly youve never been mo re fanciable Ron gagged on a large piece of kipper Hermione spared him one look of disdain before turning back to Harry Everyone knows youve been telling the truth now dont they The whole Wizarding world has had to admit that you were right about Voldemort being back and th at you really have fought him twice in the last two years and escaped both times And now theyre calling you the Chosen One well come on cant you see why people are fascinated by you Harry was finding the Great Hall very hot all of a sudden even though the ceiling still looked cold and rainy And youve been through all that persecution from the Ministry when they were trying to make out you were unstable and a liar You can still see the marks on the back of your hand where that evil woman made you write with your own blood bu t you stuck to your story anyway You can still see where those brains got hold of me in the Ministry look said Ron shaking back his sleeves And it doesnt hurt that you ve grown about a foot over the summer either Hermione finished ignoring Ron Im tall said Ron inconsequentially The post owls arrived swoop ing down through rainflecked windows scattering everyone with droplets of water Most people were receiving more post than usual anxious parents were keen to hear from their children and to re assure them in turn that all was CHAPTER ELEVEN 220 well at home Harry ha d received no mail since the start of term his only regular correspondent wa s now dead and although he had hoped that Lupin might write occa sionally he had so far been disappointed He was very surprised therefore to see the snowy white Hedwig circling amongst all the brown and gray owls She landed in front of him carrying a large square package A moment later an identical package landed in fron t of Ron crushing beneath it his minuscule and exhauste d owl Pigwidgeon Ha said Harry unwrapping the pa rcel to reveal a new copy of Advanced PotionMaking fresh from Flourish and Blotts Oh good said Hermione deligh ted Now you can give that graffitied copy back Are you mad said Harry Im keeping it Look Ive thought it out He pulled the old copy of Advanced PotionMaking out of his bag and tapped the cover wi th his wand muttering Diffindo The cover fell off He did the same thing with the brandnew book Hermione looked scandalized He then swapped the covers tapped each and said Reparo There sat the Princes copy disg uised as a new book and there sat the fresh copy from Flourish and Blotts looking thoroughly secondhand Ill give Slughorn back the new one he cant complain it cost nine Galleons Hermione pressed her lips toge ther looking angry and disapproving but was distracted by a third owl landing in front of her carrying that days copy of the Daily Prophet She unfolded it hastily and scanne d the front page HERMIONES HELPING HAND 221 Anyone we know dead asked Ron in a determinedly casual voice he posed the same questi on every time Hermione opened her paper No but there have been more dementor attacks said Hermione And an arrest Excellent who said Harry th inking of Bellatrix Lestrange Stan Shunpike said Hermione What said Harry startled Stanley Shunpike conductor on the popular Wizarding conveyance the Knight Bus has been ar rested on suspicion of Death Eater activity Mr Shunpike 21 was taken into custody late last night after a raid on his Clapham home Stan Shunpike a Death Eater said Harry remembering the spotty youth he had first met three years before No way He might have been put under the Imperius Curse said Ron reasonably You never can tell It doesnt look like it said He rmione who was still reading It says here he was arrested after he was overheard talking about the Death Eaters secret plans in a pub She looked up with a troubled expression on her face If he was under the Imperius Curse hed hardly stand around gossiping about their plan s would he It sounds like he was trying to make out he knew more than he did said Ron Isnt he the o ne who claimed he was going to become Minister of Magic when he was trying to chat up those veela Yeah thats him said Harry I dunno what theyre playing at taking Stan seriously They probably want to look as though theyre doing something said Hermione frowning P eople are terrified you know CHAPTER ELEVEN 222 the Patil twins parents want them to go home An d Eloise Midgen has already been withdr awn Her father picked her up last night What said Ron goggling at Hermione But Hogwarts is safer than their homes bound to be Weve got Aurors and all those extra protective spells and weve got Dumbledore I dont think weve got him all the time said Hermione very quietly glancing toward the st aff table over the top of the Prophet Havent you noticed His seats been empty as often as Hagrids this past week Harry and Ron looked up at the staff table The headmasters chair was indeed empty Now Harry came to think of it he had not seen Dumbledore since their private lesson a week ago I think hes left the school to do something with the Order said Hermione in a low voice I mean its all looking serious isnt it Harry and Ron did not answer bu t Harry knew that they were all thinking the same thing Ther e had been a horrible incident the day before when Hannah Abbott had been taken out of Herbology to be told her mother had b een found dead They had not seen Hannah since When they left the Gryffindor ta ble five minutes later to head down to the Quidditch pitch th ey passed Lavender Brown and Parvati Patil Remembering what Hermione had said about the Patil twins parents wanting them to leave Hogwarts Harry was unsurprised to see that the two be st friends were whispering together looking distressed What did surprise him was that when Ron drew level with them Parvat i suddenly nudged Lavender who looked around and gave Ron a wide smile Ron blinked at her then returned the smile uncertainly His walk instantly became someHERMIONES HELPING HAND 223 thing more like a strut Harry resist ed the temptation to laugh remembering that Ron had refrained from doing so after Malfoy had broken Harrys nose Hermione ho wever looked cold and distant all the way down to the stadium through the cool misty drizzle and departed to find a place in the stands without wishing Ron good luck As Harry had expected the trials took most of the morning Half of Gryffindor House seemed to have turned up from first years who were nervously clutching a selection of the dreadful old school brooms to seventh years wh o towered over the rest looking coolly intimidating Th e latter included a large wiryhaired boy Harry recognized immediately from the Hogwarts Express We met on the train in old Sluggys compartment he said confidently stepping out of th e crowd to shake Harrys hand Cormac McLaggen Keeper You didnt try out last year di d you asked Harry taking note of the breadth of McLaggen and t hinking that he would probably block all three goal hoop s without even moving I was in the hospital wing when they held the trials said McLaggen with something of a swagger Ate a pound of doxy eggs for a bet Right said Harry Well if you wait over there He pointed over to the edge of the pitch close to where Hermione was sitting He thought he saw a flicker of annoyance pass over McLaggens face and wondered whether McLaggen expected preferential treatment because they were both old Sluggys favorites Harry decided to start with a basic test asking all applicants for the team to divide into groups of ten and fly once around the pitch This was a good decision The first ten was made up of first years CHAPTER ELEVEN 224 and it could not have been plainer that they had hardly ever flown before Only one boy managed to remain airborne for more than a few seconds and he was so surprised he promptly crashed into one of the goal posts The second group was comprised of ten of the silliest girls Harry had ever encountered who when he blew his whistle merely fell about giggling and clutching o ne another Romilda Vane was amongst them When he told them to leave the pitch they did so quite cheerfully and went to sit in the stands to heckle everyone else The third group had a pileup half way around the pitch Most of the fourth group had come without broomsticks The fifth group were Hufflepuffs If theres anyone else here who s not from Gryffindor roared Harry who was starting to get se riously annoyed leave now please There was a pause then a couple of little Ravenclaws went sprinting off the pitch snorting with laughter After two hours many complaints and several tantrums one involving a crashed Comet Two Sixty and several broken teeth Harry had found himself three Chasers Ka tie Bell returned to the team after an excellent trial a new fi nd called Demelza Robins who was particularly good at dodging Bludgers and Ginny Weasley who had outflown all the competition and scored seventeen goals to boot Pleased though he was with his choices Harry had also shouted himself hoarse at the ma ny complainers and was now enduring a similar battle with the rejected Beaters Thats my final decision and if you dont get out of the way for the Keepers Ill hex you he bellowed HERMIONES HELPING HAND 225 Neither of his chosen Beaters had the old brilliance of Fred and George but he was still reasonably pleased with them Jimmy Peakes a short but broadchested thirdyear boy who had managed to raise a lump the size of an egg on the back of Harrys head with a ferociously hit Bludger and Ri tchie Coote who looked weedy but aimed well They now joined Katie Demelza and Ginny in the stands to watch the selectio n of their last team member Harry had deliberately left the tr ial of the Keepers until last hoping for an emptier stadium an d less pressure on all concerned Unfortunately however all the re jected players and a number of people who had come down to watch after a lengthy breakfast had joined the crowd by now so that it was larger than ever As each Keeper flew up to the goal hoops the crowd roared and jeered in equal measure Harry glanced over at Ron who had always had a problem with nerves Harry had ho ped that winning their final match last term might have cured it but apparently not Ron was a delicate shade of green None of the first five applicants saved more than two goals apiece To Harrys great disappoin tment Cormac McLaggen saved four penalties out of five On the la st one however he shot off in completely the wrong direction the crowd laughed and booed and McLaggen returned to the gr ound grinding his teeth Ron looked ready to pass out as he mounted his Cleansweep Eleven Good luck cried a voice from the stands Harry looked around expecting to see Hermione but it was Lavender Brown He would have quite liked to have hidden his face in his hands as she did a moment later but thought that as the Captain he ought to show slightly more grit and so turned to watch Ron do his trial Yet he need not have worried Ron saved one two three four CHAPTER ELEVEN 226 five penalties in a row Delighte d and resisting joining in the cheers of the crowd with difficul ty Harry turned to McLaggen to tell him that most unfortunatel y Ron had beaten him only to find McLaggens red face inches from his own He stepped back hastily His sister didnt really try said McLaggen menacingly There was a vein pulsing in his temple like the one Harry had often admired in Uncle Vernons She gave him an easy save Rubbish said Harry coldly That was the one he nearly missed McLaggen took a step nearer Har ry who stood his ground this time Give me another go No said Harry Youve had your go You saved four Ron saved five Rons Keeper he won it fair and square Get out of my way He thought for a moment that McLaggen might punch him but he contented himself with an ugly grimace and stormed away growling what sounded like threats to thin air Harry turned around to find his new team beaming at him Well done he croaked You flew really well You did brilliantly Ron This time it really was Hermio ne running toward them from the stands Harry saw Lavender walk ing off the pitch arm in arm with Parvati a rather grumpy ex pression on her face Ron looked extremely pleased with himself and even taller than usual as he grinned at the team and at Hermione After fixing the time of their first full practice for the following Thursday Harry Ron and Hermione bade goodbye to the rest of HERMIONES HELPING HAND 227 the team and headed o ff toward Hagrids A watery sun was trying to break through the clouds now and it had stoppe d drizzling at last Harry felt extremely hungry he hoped there would be something to eat at Hagrids I thought I was going to miss th at fourth penalty Ron was saying happily Tricky shot from De melza did you see had a bit of spin on it Yes yes you were magnificent said Hermione looking amused I was better than that McLaggen anyway said Ron in a highly satisfied voice Did you see him lumbering off in the wrong direction on his fifth Looked like hed been Confunded To Harrys surprise Hermione tur ned a very deep shade of pink at these words Ron noticed nothin g he was too busy describing each of his other penalt ies in loving detail The great gray hippogriff Buckbe ak was tethered in front of Hagrids cabin He clicked his ra zorsharp beak at their approach and turned his huge head toward them Oh dear said Hermione nervously Hes still a bit scary isnt he Come off it youve ridden him havent you said Ron Harry stepped forward and bowed low to the hippo griff without breaking eye contact or blinking After a few seconds Buckbeak sank into a bow too How are you Harry asked him in a low voice moving forward to stroke the feathery head Missing him But youre okay here with Hagrid arent you Oi said a loud voice Hagrid had come stri ding around the corner of his cabin wearing a large flowery apron and carrying a sack of potatoes His CHAPTER ELEVEN 228 enormous boarhound Fang was at his heels Fang gave a booming bark and boun ded forward Git away from him Hell have yer fingers oh Its yeh lot Fang was jumping up at Hermione and Ron attempting to lick their ears Hagrid stood and looked at them all for a split second then turned and strode into his cabin slamming the door behind him Oh dear said Hermio ne looking stricken Dont worry about it said Harry grimly He walked over to the door and knocked loudly Hagrid Open up we want to talk to you There was no sound from within If you dont open the door we ll blast it open Harry said pulling out his wand Harry said Hermione sounding shocked You cant possibly Yeah I can said Ha rry Stand back But before he could say anything else the door flew open again as Harry had known it would an d there stood Hagrid glowering down at him and looking despite the flowery apron positively alarming Im a teacher he roared at Ha rry A teacher Potter How dare yeh threaten ter br eak down my door Im sorry sir said Harry emphasizing the last word as he stowed his wand inside his robes Hagrid looked stunned Since when have yeh called me sir Since when have you called me Potter Oh very clever growled Hagr id Very amusin Thats me outsmarted innit All righ come in then yeh ungrateful little HERMIONES HELPING HAND 229 Mumbling darkly he stood back to let them pass Hermione scurried in after Harry looking rather frightened Well said Hagrid grumpily as Harry Ro n and Hermione sat down around his enormous wooden table Fang laying his head immediately upon Harrys knee and drooling all over his robes Whats this Feelin sorry for me Reckon Im lonely or summat No said Harry at once We wanted to see you Weve missed you said Hermione tremulously Missed me have yeh snor ted Hagrid Yeah Righ He stomped around brewing up tea in his enormous copper kettle muttering all the while Finally he slammed down three bucketsized mugs of mahoganybro wn tea in front of them and a plate of his rock cakes Harry wa s hungry enough even for Hagrids cooking and took one at once Hagrid said Hermione timidly when he joined them at the table and started peeling his pota toes with a brutality that suggested that each tuber had done hi m a great personal wrong we really wanted to carry on with Care of Magical Creatures you know Hagrid gave another great snort Harry rather thought some bogeys landed on the potatoes and was inwardly thankful that they were not staying for dinner We did said Hermione But no ne of us could fit it into our schedules Yeah Righ said Hagrid again There was a funny squelching soun d and they all looked around Hermione let out a tiny shriek and Ron leapt out of his seat and hurried around the table away from the large barrel standing in the corner that they had only just noti ced It was full of what looked like footlong maggots sl imy white and writhing CHAPTER ELEVEN 230 What are they Hagrid asked Harry trying to sound interested rather than revolted but pu tting down his rock cake all the same Jus giant grubs said Hagrid And they grow into said Ron looking apprehensive They won grow inter nuthin said Hagrid I got em ter feed ter Aragog And without warning he burst into tears Hagrid cried Herm ione leaping up hu rrying around the table the long way to avoid the barrel of maggots and putting an arm around his shaking sh oulders What is it Its him gulped Hagrid his beetleblack eyes streaming as he mopped his face with his apron Its Aragog I think hes dyin He got ill over the summer an hes not gettin better I don know what Ill do if he if he Weve bin tergether so long Hermione patted Hagrids should er looking at a complete loss for anything to say Harry knew how she felt He had known Hagrid to present a vicious baby dr agon with a teddy bear seen him croon over giant scorpions with suckers and stingers attempt to reason with his brutal giant of a halfbrother but this was perhaps the most incomprehensible of all his monster fancies the gigantic talking spider Aragog who dwelle d deep in the Forbidden Forest and which he and Ron had only narrowly escaped four years previously Is there is there anything we can do Hermione asked ignoring Rons frantic grimaces and headshakings I don think there is Hermione choked Hagrid attempting HERMIONES HELPING HAND 231 to stem the flood of his tears See the rest o the tribe Aragogs family theyre gettin a bit funny now hes ill bit restive Yeah I think we saw a bit of that side of them said Ron in an undertone I don reckon itd be safe fer anyone but me ter go near the colony at the mo Hagrid finished blowing his nose hard on his apron and looking up But thanks fer offerin Hermione It means a lot After that the atmosphere lightened considerably for although neither Harry nor Ron had shown any inclination to go and feed giant grubs to a murderous gargantuan spider Hagrid seemed to take it for granted that they woul d have liked to have done and became his usual se lf once more Ar I always knew yehd find it hard ter squeeze me inter yer timetables he said gruffly pouring them more tea Even if yeh applied fer TimeTurners We couldnt have done said Hermione We smashed the entire stock of Ministry TimeTurne rs when we were there last summer It was in the Daily Prophet Ar well then said Hagrid T heres no way yeh couldve done it Im sorry Ive bin yeh kn ow Ive jus bin worried abou Aragog an I did wonder whether if Professor GrubblyPlank had bin teachin yeh At which all three of them stated categorically and untruthfully that Professor GrubblyPlank wh o had substituted for Hagrid a few times was a dreadful teacher with the result that by the time Hagrid waved them off the premis es at dusk he looked quite cheerful CHAPTER ELEVEN 232 Im starving said Harry on ce the door had closed behind them and they were hurrying th rough the dark and deserted grounds he had abandoned the rock cake after an ominous cracking noise from one of his back teet h And Ive got that detention with Snape tonight I havent got much time for dinner As they came into the castle they spotted Cormac McLaggen entering the Great Hall It took hi m two attempts to get through the doors he ricocheted off the frame on the first atte mpt Ron merely guffawed gloatingly and strode of f into the Hall after him but Harry caught Hermiones arm and held her back What said Hermio ne defensively If you ask me said Harry quie tly McLaggen looks like he was Confunded this morning And he was standing right in front of where you were sitting Hermione blushed Oh all right then I did it she whispered But you should have heard the way he was talking about Ron and Ginny Anyway hes got a nasty temper yo u saw how he reacted when he didnt get in you wo uldnt have wanted someone like that on the team No said Harry No I suppose th ats true But wasnt that dishonest Hermione I mean you re a prefect arent you Oh be quiet she snap ped as he smirked What are you two doing demand ed Ron reappearing in the doorway to the Great Hall and looking suspicious Nothing said Harry and Herm ione together and they hurried after Ron The smell of roast beef made Harrys stomach ache with hunger but they had barely taken three steps toward the Gryffin HERMIONES HELPING HAND 233 dor table when Professor Slughorn appeared in front of them blocking their path Harry Harry just the man I was hoping to see he boomed genially twiddling the ends of his walrus mustache and puffing out his enormous belly I was hoping to catch you before dinner What do you say to a spot of supper toni ght in my rooms instead Were having a little party just a few rising stars Ive got McLaggen coming and Zabini the charming Me linda Bobbin I dont know whether you know her Her family owns a large chain of apothecaries and of course I hope very much that Miss Granger will favor me by coming too Slughorn made Hermione a little bo w as he finished speaking It was as though Ron was not present Slughorn did not so much as look at him I cant come Professor said Harry at once Ive got a detention with Prof essor Snape Oh dear said Slughorn his face falling comically Dear dear I was counting on you Harry Well no w Ill just have to have a word with Severus and explain the situation Im sure Ill be able to persuade him to postpone your detentio n Yes Ill see you both later He bustled away out of the Hall Hes got no chance of persuadi ng Snape said Harry the moment Slughorn was out of earshot This detentions already been postponed once Snape did it for Dumbledore but he wont do it for anyone else Oh I wish you could come I don t want to go on my own said Hermione anxiously Harry k new that she was thinking about McLaggen CHAPTER ELEVEN 234 I doubt youll be alone Ginny ll probably be invited snapped Ron who did not seem to have ta ken kindly to being ignored by Slughorn After dinner they made their way back to Gryffindor Tower The common room was very crowded as most people had finished dinner by now but they managed to find a free table and sat down Ron who had been in a bad mood ever since the encounter with Slughorn folded his arms and frowned at the ceiling Hermione reached out for a copy of the Evening Prophet which somebody had left abandoned on a chair Anything new said Harry Not really Hermione ha d opened the newspaper and was scanning the inside pages Oh look your dads in here Ron hes all right she added quickly for Ron had looked around in alarm It just says hes been to visit the Malfoys house This second search of the Death Eaters residence does not seem to have yielded any results Arthur Weasley of the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects said that his team had been acting up on a confidential tipoff Yeah mine said Harry I to ld him at Kings Cross about Malfoy and that thing he was trying to get Borgin to fix Well if its not at their house he must have brou ght whatever it is to Hogwarts with him But how can he have done Harry said Hermione putting down the newspaper with a surprise d look We were all searched when we arrived werent we Were you said Harry ta ken aback I wasnt Oh no of course you werent I forgot you were late Well Filch ran over all of us with Se crecy Sensors when we got into the HERMIONES HELPING HAND 235 entrance hall Any Dark object wo uld have been found I know for a fact Crabbe had a shrunken head confiscated So you see Malfoy cant have brought in anything dangerous Momentarily stymied Harry wa tched Ginny Weasley playing with Arnold the Pygmy Puff for a while before seeing a way around this objection Someones sent it to him by owl then he said His mother or someone All the owls are being checked to o said Hermione Filch told u s s o w h e n h e w a s j a b b i n g t h o s e Secrecy Sensors everywhere he could reach Really stumped this time Harry found nothing else to say There did not seem to be any wa y Malfoy could have brought a dangerous or Dark object into th e school He looked hopefully at Ron who was sitting with his arms folded staring over at Lavender Brown Can you think of any way Malfoy Oh drop it Harry said Ron Listen its not my fault Slug horn invited Hermione and me to his stupid party neither of us wa nted to go you know said Harry firing up Well as Im not invited to any parties said Ron getting to his feet again I thin k Ill go to bed He stomped off toward the door to the boys dormitories leaving Harry and Hermione staring after him Harry said the new Chaser Demelza Robins appearing suddenly at his shoulder Ive got a message for you From Professor Slughorn asked Harry sitting up hopefully No from Professor Snape said Demelza Harrys heart CHAPTER ELEVEN 236 sank He says youre to come to hi s office at half past eight tonight to do your detention er no matter how many party invitations youve received And he want ed you to know youll be sorting out rotten flobberworms from good ones to use in Potions and and he says theres no need to bring protective gloves Right said Harry grimly Thanks a lot Demelza T W E L V E 237 SILVER AND OPALS here was Dumbledore and what was he doing Harry caught sight of the headmaster only twice over the next few weeks He rarely appeared at meals anymore and Harry was sure Hermione was right in thinking that he was leaving the school for days at a time Had Dumbledor e forgotten the lessons he was supposed to be giving Harry Dumb ledore had said that the lessons were leading to something to do with the prophecy Harry had felt bolstered comforted and now he felt slightly abandoned Halfway through October came thei r first trip of the term to Hogsmeade Harry had wondered wh ether these trips would still be allowed given the increasingly tight security measures around the school but was please d to know that they were going ahead it was always good to get out of the castle grounds for a few hours Harry woke early on the morning of the trip which was proving stormy and whiled away the time until breakfast by reading his copy of Advanced PotionMaking He did not usually lie in bed W CHAPTER TWELVE 238 reading his textbooks that sort of behavior as Ron rightly said was indecent in anybody except Herm ione who was simply weird that way Harry felt however that th e HalfBlood Princes copy of Advanced PotionMaking hardly qualified as a textbook The more Harry pored over the b ook the more he realiz ed how much was in there not only the handy hints an d shortcuts on po tions that were earning him such a glowing reputati on with Slughorn but also the imaginative little jinxes and hexes scribbled in the margins which Harry was sure judging by the crossi ngsout and revisions that the Prince had invented himself Harry had already atte mpted a few of the Princes selfinvented spells There had been a hex that caused toenails to grow alarmingly fast he had tried this on Crabbe in the corridor with very entertaining results a jinx that glued the tongue to the roof of the mouth which he had twice used to general applause on an unsuspecting Argus Filch and perhaps most useful of all Muffliato a spell that filled the ears of anyone nearby with an unidentifiable buzzing so that lengthy conversations could be held in class without being overheard The only person who did not find these charms amusing was Hermione who maintained a rigidly disapproving expression throughout and refused to talk at all if Harry had used the Muffliato spell on anyone in the vicinity Sitting up in bed Harry turned the book sideways so as to examine more closely the scribbled instructions fo r a spell that seemed to have caused the Prince some trouble There were many crossingsout and alterations but fi nally crammed into a corner of the page the scribble Levicorpus nvbl SILVER AND OPALS 239 While the wind and sleet pounde d relentlessly on the windows and Neville snored loudly Harry star ed at the letters in brackets Nvbl that had to mean nonve rbal Harry rather doubted he would be able to bring off this part icular spell he was still having difficulty with nonverbal spells something Snape had been quick t o c o m m e n t o n i n e v e r y D A D A c l a s s O n t h e o t h e r h a n d t h e Prince had proved a much more effe ctive teacher than Snape so far Pointing his wand at nothing in pa rticular he gave it an upward flick and said Levicorpus inside his head Aaaaaaaargh There was a flash of light and the room was full of voices Everyone had woken up as Ron ha d let out a yell Harry sent Advanced PotionMaking flying in panic Ron wa s dangling upside down in midair as though an invisible hook had hoisted him up by the ankle Sorry yelled Harry as Dean and Seamus roared with laughter and Neville picked hims elf up from the floor having fallen out of bed Hang on I ll let you down He groped for the potion book an d riffled through it in a panic trying to find the right page at last he located it and deciphered one cramped word underneath the sp ell Praying that this was the counterjinx Harry thought Liberacorpus with all his might There was another flash of light and Ron fell in a heap onto his mattress Sorry repeated Harry weakly while Dean and Seamus continued to roar with laughter Tomorrow said Ron in a muffled voice Id rather you set the alarm clock By the time they had got dresse d padding themselves out with CHAPTER TWELVE 240 several of Mrs Weasleys handk nitted sweaters and carrying cloaks scarves and gloves Ron s shock had subsided and he had decided that Harrys new spell was hi ghly amusing so amusing in f a c t t h a t h e l o s t n o t i m e i n r e galing Hermione with the story as they sat down for breakfast and then there was another flash of light and I landed on the bed again Ron grinned helping himself to sausages Hermione had not cracked a smile during this anecdote and now turned an expression of wintry disapproval upon Harry Was this spell by any chance another one from that potion book of yours she asked Harry frowned at her Always jump to the worst conclusion dont you Was it Well yeah it was but so what So you just decided to try ou t an unknown handwritten incantation and see wh at would happen Why does it matter if its hand written said Harry preferring not to answer the rest of the question Because its probably not Ministry of Magicapproved said Hermione And also she added as Harry and Ron rolled their eyes because Im starting to thin k this Prince character was a bit dodgy Both Harry and Ron shou ted her down at once It was a laugh said Ron upend ing a ketchup bottle over his sausages Just a laugh Hermione thats all Dangling people upside down by the ankle said Hermione Who puts their time and ener gy into making up spells like that SILVER AND OPALS 241 Fred and George said Ron shru gging its their kind of thing And er My dad said Harry He had only just remembered What said Ron and Hermione together My dad used this spell said Harry I Lupin told me This last part was not true in fact Harry had seen his father use the spell on Snape but he had never told Ron and Hermione about that particular excursion into th e Pensieve Now however a wonderful possibility occurred to him Could the HalfBlood Prince possibly be Maybe your dad did use it Harr y said Hermione but hes not the only one Weve seen a whole bunch of people use it in case youve forgotten Dangling people in the air Making them float along asleep helpless Harry stared at her With a sink ing feeling he too remembered the behavior of the Death Eaters at the Quidditch World Cup Ron came to his aid That was different he said ro bustly They were abusing it Harry and his dad were just having a laugh You dont like the Prince Hermione he added poin ting a sausage at her sternly because hes better th an you at Potions Its got nothing to do with that said Hermione her cheeks reddening I just think its very irresponsible to start performing spells when you dont even know what theyre for and stop talking about the Prince as if its his titl e I bet its just a stupid nickname and it doesnt seem as though he was a very nice person to me I dont see where you get that from said Harry heatedly If hed been a budding Death Eater he wouldnt have been boasting about being halfbl ood would he CHAPTER TWELVE 242 Even as he said it Harry reme mbered that his father had been pureblood but he pushed the th ought out of his mind he would worry about that later The Death Eaters cant all be pureblood there arent enough pureblood wizards left said Hermione stubbornly I expect most of them are halfbloods pretending to be pure Its only Muggleborns they hate theyd be quite happy to let you and Ron join up There is no way theyd let me be a Death Eater said Ron indignantly a bit of sausage flying off the fork he was now brandishing at Hermione and hitting Erni e Macmillan on the head My whole family are blood traitors That s as bad as Muggleborns to Death Eaters And theyd love to have me said Harry sarcastically Wed be best pals if they didnt keep trying to do me in This made Ron laugh even Herm ione gave a grudging smile and a distraction arrived in the shape of Ginny Hey Harry Im supposed to give you this It was a scroll of parchment with Harrys name written upon it in familiar thin slanting writing Thanks Ginny Its Dumbledores next lesson Harry told Ron and Hermione pulling open the parchment and quickly reading its contents Monday evenin g He felt suddenly light and happy Want to join us in Hogsmeade Ginny he asked Im going with Dean might see you there she replied waving at them as she left Filch was standing at the oak fr ont doors as usual checking off the names of people who had permission to go into Hogsmeade The process took even longer th an normal as Filch was triplechecking everybody with his Secrecy Sensor SILVER AND OPALS 243 What does it matter if were smuggling Dark stuff OUT demanded Ron eyeing the long thin Secrecy Sensor with apprehension Surely you ought to be checking what we bring back IN His cheek earned him a few extra jabs with the Sensor and he was still wincing as they steppe d out into the wind and sleet The walk into Hogsmeade was not enjoyable Harry wrapped his scarf over his lower face the exposed part soon felt both raw and numb The road to the village was full of students bent double against the bitter wind More th an once Harry wondered whether they might not have had a better time in the warm common room and when they finally reached Hogsmeade and saw that Zonkos Joke Shop had been boarded up Harry took it as confirmation that this trip was not destined to be fun Ron pointed with a thickly gloved hand toward Ho neydukes which was mercifully open and Harry and Hermione sta ggered in his wake into the crowded shop Thank God shivered Ron as they were enveloped by warm toffeescented air Lets stay here all afternoon Harry mboy said a boom ing voice from behind them Oh no muttered Harry The thr ee of them turned to see Professor Slughorn who was wearin g an enormous furry hat and an overcoat with matching fur collar clutching a large bag of crystalized pineapple and occupying at least a quarter of the shop Harry thats three of my little suppers youve missed now said Slughorn poking him genially in the chest It wont do mboy Im determined to have you Miss Granger loves them dont you Yes said Hermione helplessly theyre really So why dont yo u come along Harry demanded Slughorn Well Ive had Quidditch practi ce Professor said Harry who CHAPTER TWELVE 244 had indeed been scheduling practice s every time Slughorn had sent him a little violet ri bbonadorned invitation This strategy meant that Ron was not left out and they usually had a laugh with Ginny imagining Hermione shut up with McLaggen and Zabini Well I certainly expect you to wi n your first match after all this hard work said Slughorn But a little recreation never hurt anybody Now how about Monday nigh t you cant possibly want to practice in this weather I cant Professor Ive got er an appointment with Professor Dumbledore that evening Unlucky again cried Slughorn dramatically Ah well you cant evade me fo rever Harry And with a regal wave he waddled out of the shop taking as little notice of Ron as though he had been a display of Cockroach Clusters I cant believe youve wriggled out of another one said Hermione shaking her head Theyre not that bad you know Theyre even quite fun sometimes Bu t then she caught sight of Rons expression Oh look theyve got deluxe sugar quills those would last hours Glad that Hermione had changed the subject Harry showed much more interest in the new ex tralarge sugar quills than he would normally have done but Ro n continued to look moody and merely shrugged when Hermione asked him where he wanted to go next Lets go to the Three Broomsticks said Harry Itll be warm They bundled their scarves back over their faces and left the sweetshop The bitter wind was like knives on their faces after the sugary warmth of Honeydukes The street was not very busy noSILVER AND OPALS 245 body was lingering to chat just hurrying toward their destinations The exceptions were two men a little ahead of them standing just outside the Three Broomsticks One was very tall and thin squinting through his rainwashed glasse s Harry recognized the barman who worked in the other Hogsmeade pub the Hogs Head As Harry Ron and Hermione drew clos er the barman drew his cloak more tightly around his neck and walked away leaving the shorter man to fumble with something in his arms They were barely feet from him when Harry realized who the man was Mundungus The squat bandylegged man with long straggly ginger hair jumped and dropped an ancient su itcase which burst open releasing what looked like the entire contents of a ju nk shop window Oh ello Arry said Mundungu s Fletcher with a most unconvincing stab at airiness Well dont let me keep ya And he began scrabbling on the ground to retrieve the contents of his suitcase with every appear ance of a man eager to be gone Are you selling this stuff asked Harry watching Mundungus grab an assortment of grubbylooking objects from the ground O h w e l l g o t t a s c r a p e a l i v i n g s a i d M u n d u n g u s G i m m e that Ron had stooped down and pi cked up something silver Hang on Ron said slowly This looks familiar Thank you said Mundungus snatching the goblet out of Rons hand and stuffing it back into the case Well Ill see you all OUCH Harry had pinned Mundungus ag ainst the wall of the pub by the throat Holding him fast wi th one hand he pulled out his wand CHAPTER TWELVE 246 Harry squeal ed Hermione You took that from Siriuss ho use said Harry who was almost nose to nose with Mundungus and was breathing in an unpleasant smell of old tobacco an d spirits That had th e Black family crest on it I no what spluttered Mundungus who was slowly turning purple What did you do go back the night he died and strip the place snarled Harry I no Give it to me Harry you mustnt shrieked Hermione as Mundungus started to turn blue There was a bang and Harry felt his hands fly off Mundunguss throat Gasping and spluttering Mundungus seized his fallen case then CRACK he Disapparated Harry swore at the top of his voice spinning on the spot to see where Mundungus had gone COME BACK YOU THIEVING Theres no point Harry Tonks had appeared out of nowhere her mousy hair wet with sleet Mundungus will probably be in London by now Theres no point yelling Hes nicked Siriuss stuff Nicked it Yes but still said Tonks who seemed perfectly untroubled by this piece of informat ion You should get out of the cold She watched them go through the door of the Three Broomsticks SILVER AND OPALS 247 The moment he was inside Harry burst out He was nicking Siriuss stuff I know Harry but please dont sh out people are staring whispered Hermione Go and sit do wn Ill get you a drink Harry was still fuming when Hermio ne returned to their table a few minutes later holding th ree bottles of butterbeer Cant the Order control Mundungus Harry demanded of the other two in a furious whisper Can t they at least stop him stealing everything thats not fixed down when hes at headquarters Shh said Hermione desperately looking around to make sure nobody was listening there were a couple of warlocks sitting close by who were staring at Harry with great interest and Zabini was lolling against a pillar not far away Harry Id be annoyed too I know its your things hes stealing Harry gagged on his butterbeer he had momentarily forgotten that he owned nu mber twelve Grimmauld Place Yeah its my stuff he said No wonder he wasnt pleased to see me Well Im going to tell Dumbledore whats going on hes the only one who scares Mundungus Good idea whispered Hermione clearly pleased that Harry was calming down Ron what are you staring at Nothing said Ron hastily look ing away from the bar but Harry knew he was trying to catch the eye of the curvy and attractive barmaid Madam Rosmerta for whom he had long nursed a soft spot I expect nothings in the back getting more firewhisky said Hermione waspishly Ron ignored this jibe sipping hi s drink in what he evidently considered to be a dignified sile nce Harry was thinking about Sirius and how he had hated those silver goblets anyway Hermione CHAPTER TWELVE 248 drummed her fingers on the table her eyes flickering between Ron and the bar The moment Harry dr ained the last dr ops in his bottle she said Shall we call it a day and go back to school then The other two nodded it had not been a fun trip and the weather was getting worse the longer they stayed Once again they drew their cloaks tightly around them rearranged their scarves pulled on their gloves then followed Katie Bell and a friend out of the pub and back up the High St reet Harrys thoughts strayed to Ginny as they trudged up the road to Hogwarts through the frozen slush They had not met up with her undoubtedly thought Harry because she and Dean were cozily closeted in Madam Puddifoots Tea Shop that haunt of happy co uples Scowling he bowed his head against the swirling sleet and trudged on It was a little while before Harry became awar e that the voices of Katie Bell and her friend which we re being carried back to him on the wind had become shriller an d louder Harry squinted at their indistinct figures The two girls were having an argument about something Katie was holding in he r hand Its nothing to do with you Leanne Harr y heard Katie say They rounded a corner in the la ne sleet coming thick and fast blurring Harrys glasses Just as he raised a gloved hand to wipe them Leanne made to grab hold of the package Katie was holding Katie tugged it back and the package fell to the ground At once Katie rose into the air not as Ron had done suspended comically by the ankle but gracefully her arms outstretched as though she was about to fly Yet there was something wrong something eerie Her hair was whipped around her by the fierce wind but her eyes were closed an d her face was qu ite empty of SILVER AND OPALS 249 expression Harry Ron Hermione and Leanne had all halted in their tracks watching Then six feet above the ground Katie let out a terrible scream Her eyes flew open but whatever she could see or whatever she was feeling was clearly causing her terr ible anguish She screamed and screamed Leanne started to scream too and seized Katies ankles trying to tug her back to the ground Harry Ron and Hermione rushed forward to help but even as they grabbed Katies legs she fell on top of them Harry and Ro n managed to catch her but she was writhing so much they could hardly hold her Instead they lowered her to the ground where sh e thrashed and screamed apparently unable to recognize any of them Harry looked around the landscape seemed deserted Stay there he shouted at the others over the howling wind Im going for help He began to sprint toward the school he had never seen anyone behave as Katie had just behave d and could not think what had caused it he hurtled around a b end in the lane and collided with what seemed to be an enor mous bear on its hind legs Hagrid he panted disentangl ing himself from the hedgerow into which he had fallen Harry said Hagrid who had sleet trapped in his eyebrows and beard and was wearing his great shaggy beaverskin coat Jus bin visitin Grawp hes comin on so well ye h wouldn Hagrid someones hurt back there or cursed or something Wha said Hagrid bending lowe r to hear what Harry was saying over the raging wind Someones been cursed bellowed Harry CHAPTER TWELVE 250 Cursed Whos bin cursed not Ron Hermione No its not them its Ka tie Bell this way Together they ran back along the lane It took them no time to find the little group of people arou nd Katie who was still writhing and screaming on the ground Ro n Hermione and Leanne were all trying to quiet her Get back shouted Hagrid Lemme see her Somethings happened to her so bbed Leanne I dont know what Hagrid stared at Katie for a second then without a word bent down scooped her into his arms and ran off toward the castle with her Within seconds Katies pier cing screams had died away and the only sound was the roar of the wind Hermione hurried over to Katies wailing friend and put an arm around her Its Leanne isnt it The girl nodded Did it just happen all of a sudden or It was when that package tore sobbed Leanne pointing at the now sodden brownpaper package on the ground which had split open to reveal a greenish glitte r Ron bent down his hand outstretched but Harry seized his arm and pulled him back Dont touch it He crouched down An ornate opal necklace was visible poking out of the paper Ive seen that before said Harry staring at the thing It was on display in Borgin and Burkes ages ago The label said it was cursed Katie must have touched it He looked up at Leanne who SILVER AND OPALS 251 had started to shake uncontrollab ly How did Katie get hold of this Well thats why we were argu ing She came back from the bathroom in the Three Broomsticks holding it said it was a surprise for somebody at Hogwarts and she had to deliver it She looked all funny when she said it Oh no oh no I bet shed been Imperiused and I didnt realize Leanne shook with renewed sobs Hermione patted her shoulder gently She didnt say whod give n it to her Leanne No she wouldnt te ll me and I said she was being stupid and not to take it up to school bu t she just wouldnt listen and and then I tried to grab it from her and and Leanne let out a wail of despair Wed better get up to school said Hermione her arm still around Leanne Well be able to fi nd out how she is Come on Harry hesitated for a moment then pulled his scarf from around his face and ignoring Rons gasp carefully covered the necklace in it and picked it up Well need to show this to Madam Pomfrey he said As they followed Hermione and Leanne up the road Harry was thinking furiously They had ju st entered the grounds when he spoke unable to keep his th oughts to himself any longer Malfoy knows about this necklace It was in a case at Borgin and Burkes four years ago I saw him having a good look at it while I was hiding from him and his dad This is what he was buying that day when we followed him He remembered it and he went back for it I I dunno Harry said Ron he sitantly Loads of people go CHAPTER TWELVE 252 to Borgin and Burkes and didnt that girl say Katie got it in the girls bathroom She said she came back from th e bathroom with it she didnt necessarily get it in th e bathroom itself McGonagall said Ron warningly Harry looked up Sure enough Professor McGonagall was hurrying down the stone st eps through swirling sleet to meet them Hagrid says you four saw what happened to Katie Bell upstairs to my office at once pl ease Whats that youre holding Potter Its the thing she touched said Harry Good lord said Professor McGo nagall looking alarmed as she took the necklace from Harry No no Filch theyre with me she added hastily as Filch came sh uffling eagerly ac ross the entrance hall holding his Secrecy Sensor aloft Take this necklace to Professor Snape at once but be sure not to touch it keep it wrapped in the scarf Harry and the others followed Pr ofessor McGonagall upstairs and into her office The sleetspa ttered windows were rattling in their frames and the room was chil ly despite the fire crackling in the grate Professor McGonagall closed the door and swept around her desk to face Harry Ron Hermione and the still sobbing Leanne Well she said sharply What happened Haltingly and with many pauses while she attempted to control her crying Leanne told Professo r McGonagall how Katie had gone to the bathroom in the Three Br oomsticks and returned holding the unmarked package how Katie had seemed a little odd and SILVER AND OPALS 253 how they had argued about the advisability of agreeing to deliver unknown objects the argument cu lminating in the tussle over the parcel which tore open At this point Leanne was so overcome there was no getting anot her word out of her All right said Professor McGo nagall not unkindly go up to the hospital wing please Leanne and get Madam Pomfrey to give you something for shock When she had left the room Pro fessor McGonagall turned back to Harry Ron and Hermione What happened when Kati e touched the necklace She rose up in the air said Ha rry before either Ron or Hermione could speak and then began to scream and collapsed Professor can I see Professo r Dumbledore please The headmaster is away until Monday Potter said Professor McGonagall looking surprised Away Harry repeated angrily Yes Potter away said Profe ssor McGonagall tartly But anything you have to say about this horrible business can be said to me Im sure For a split second Harry hesitate d Professor McGonagall did not invite confidences Dumbledore though in many ways more intimidating still seemed less likely to scorn a theory however wild This was a lifeanddeath ma tter though and no moment to worry about being laughed at I think Draco Malfoy gave Katie that necklace Professor On one side of him Ron rubbed his nose in apparent embarrassment on the other Hermione shuffled her feet as though quite keen to put a bit of distance between herself and Harry CHAPTER TWELVE 254 That is a very serious accusation Potter said Professor McGonagall after a shoc ked pause Do you have any proof No said Harry but and he told her about following Malfoy to Borgin and Burkes and the conversation they had overheard between him and Mr Borgin When he had finished speaking Professor McGonagall looked slightly confused Malfoy took something to Borgin and Burkes for repair No Professor he just wanted Borgin to tell him how to mend something he didnt have it with him But thats not the point the thing is that he bought something at the same time and I think it was that necklace You saw Malfoy leaving the sh op with a similar package No Professor he told Borgin to keep it in the shop for him But Harry Hermione interrupted Borgin asked him if he wanted to take it with him and Malfoy said no Because he didnt want to to uch it obviously said Harry angrily What he actually said was How would I look carrying that down the street said Hermione Well he would look a bit of a prat carrying a necklace interjected Ron Oh Ron said Hermione desp airingly it would be all wrapped up so he wouldnt have to touch it and quite easy to hide inside a cloak so nobody would s ee it I think whatever he reserved at Borgin and Burkes was noisy or bulky something he knew would draw attention to him if he carried it down the street and in any case she pres sed on loudly before Harry could interrupt I asked Borgin about the neck lace dont you remember When I SILVER AND OPALS 255 went in to try and find out what Malfoy had asked him to keep I saw it there And Borgin just told me the price he didnt say it was already sold or anything Well you were being really obvious he realized what you were up to within about five seconds of course he wasnt going to tell you anyway Malfoy couldve sent off for it since Thats enough said Profe ssor McGonagall as Hermione opened her mouth to retort looking furious Potter I appreciate you telling me this but we cannot point the finger of blame at Mr Malfoy purely because he visited the shop where this necklace might have been purchased The same is probably true of hundreds of people thats what I said muttered Ron and in any case we have put stringent security measures in place this year I do not believe th at necklace can possibly have entered this school without our knowledge But and what is more said Pr ofessor McGonagall with an air of awful finality Mr Malfoy was not in Hogsmeade today Harry gaped at he r deflating How do you know Professor Because he was doing detention with me He has now failed to complete his Transfiguration home work twice in a row So thank you for telling me your suspicions Potter she said as she marched past them but I need to go up to the hospital wing now to check on Katie Bell Good day to you all She held open her office door They had no choice but to file past her without another word Harry was angry with the other tw o for siding with McGonagall CHAPTER TWELVE 256 nevertheless he felt compelled to join in once they started discussing what had happened So who do you reckon Katie wa s supposed to give the necklace to asked Ron as th ey climbed the stairs to the common room Goodness only knows said He rmione But wh oever it was has had a narrow escape No one could have opened that package without touching the necklace It couldve been mean t for loads of people said Harry Dumbledore the Death Eaters would lo ve to get rid of him he must be one of their top targets Or Slughorn Dumbledore reckons Voldemort really wanted him and th ey cant be pleased that hes sided with Dumb ledore Or Or you said Hermione looking troubled Couldnt have been said Harry or Katie wouldve just turned around in the lane and given it to me wouldnt she I was behind her all the way out of the Three Broomsticks It would have made much more sense to deliver the pa rcel outside Hogwarts what with Filch searching everyone who goes in and out I wonder why Malfoy told her to take it into the castle Harry Malfoy wasnt in Hogsme ade said Hermione actually stamping her foot in frustration He must have used an accomp lice then said Harry Crabbe or Goyle or come to think of it another Death Eater hell have loads better cronies th an Crabbe and Goyle now hes joined up Ron and Hermione exchanged looks that plainly said Theres no point arguing with him Dilligrout said Hermione firmly as they reached the Fat Lady The portrait swung open to ad mit them to the common room It was quite full and smelled of damp clothing many people SILVER AND OPALS 257 seemed to have returned from Ho gsmeade early because of the bad weather There was no buzz of fear or speculation however Clearly the news of Katies fate had not yet spread It wasnt a very slick attack really when you stop and think about it said Ron casually turf ing a first year out of one of the good armchairs by the fire so that he could sit down The curse didnt even make it in to the castle Not what youd call foolproof Youre right said Hermione prodding Ron out of the chair with her foot and offering it to the first year again It wasnt very well thoughtout at all But since when has Malfoy been one of the worlds great thinkers asked Harry Neither Ron nor Herm ione answered him T H I R T E E N 258 THE SECRET RIDDLE atie was removed to St Mungos Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries the follo wing day by which time the news that she had been cursed ha d spread all over the school though the details were confuse d and nobody other than Harry Ron Hermione and Leanne seemed to know that Katie herself had not been the intended target Oh and Malfoy knows of course said Harry to Ron and Hermione who continued their new policy of feigning deafness whenever Harry mentioned his MalfoyIsaDeathEater theory Harry had wondered whether Du mbledore would return from wherever he had been in time for Monday ni ghts lesson but having had no word to the contrary he presented himself outside Dumbledores office at eight ocloc k knocked and was told to enter There sat Dumbledore looking unusually tired his hand was as black and burned as ever but he sm iled when he gestured to Harry K THE SECRET RIDDLE 259 to sit down The Pensieve was sittin g on the desk again casting silvery specks of light over the ceiling You have had a busy time whil e I have been away Dumbledore said I believe you wi tnessed Katie s accident Yes sir How is she Still very unwell although she was relatively lucky She appears to have brushed the necklace with the smallest possible amount of skin There was a tiny hole in her glove Had she put it on had she even held it in her ungloved hand she would have died perhaps instantly Luckily Professor Snape was able to do enough to prevent a rapid spread of the curse Why him asked Harry quickly Why not Madam Pomfrey Impertinent said a soft voice from one of the portraits on the wall and Phineas Nigellus Black Siriuss greatgreatgrandfather raised his head from his arms where he had appeared to be sleeping I would not have permitted a st udent to question the way Hogwarts operated in my day Yes thank you Phineas said Dumbledore quellingly Professor Snape knows much more abou t the Dark Arts than Madam Pomfrey Harry Anyway the St Mungos staff are sending me hourly reports and I am hopeful that Katie will ma ke a full recovery in time Where were you this weekend sir Harry asked disregarding a strong feeling that he might be pushing his luck a feeling apparently shared by Phineas Ni gellus who hissed softly I would rather not say just now said Dumbledore However I shall tell you in due course You will said Harry startled CHAPTER THIRTEEN 260 Yes I expect so said Dumble dore withdrawing a fresh bottle of silver memories from inside his robes and uncorking it with a prod of his wand Sir said Harry tentatively I met Mundungus in Hogsmeade Ah yes I am already aware that Mundungus has been treating your inheritance with lightfinger ed contempt said Dumbledore frowning a little He has gone to ground since you accosted him outside the Three Broomsticks I rath er think he dreads facing me However rest assured that he will not be making away with any more of Siriuss old possessions That mangy old halfblood has b een stealing Blac k heirlooms said Phineas Nigellus incensed an d he stalked out of his frame undoubtedly to visit his portrait in number twelve Grimmauld Place Professor said Harry after a short pause did Professor McGonagall tell you what I told her after Katie got hurt About Draco Malfoy She told me of your suspicions yes said Dumbledore And do you I shall take all appropriate me asures to investigate anyone who might have had a hand in Katies accident said Dumbledore But what concerns me now Harry is our lesson Harry felt slightly resentful at this If their lessons were so very important why had there been such a long gap between the first and second However he said no more about Draco Malfoy but watched as Dumbledore poured th e fresh memories into the Pensieve and began swirling the st one basin once more between his longfingered hands Y o u w i l l r e m e m b e r I a m s u r e t h a t w e l e f t t h e t a l e o f L o r d THE SECRET RIDDLE 261 Voldemorts beginnings at the point where the handsome Muggle Tom Riddle had abandoned his wi tch wife Merope and returned to his family home in Little Hang leton Merope was left alone in London expecting the baby wh o would one day become Lord Voldemort How do you know she was in London sir Because of the evidence of o ne Caractacus Burke said Dumbledore who by an odd coincidence helped found the very shop whence came the necklace we have just been discussing He swilled the contents of the Pensieve as Harry had seen him swill them before much as a gold prospector sifts for gold Up out of the swirling silvery mass rose a little old man revolving slowly in the Pensieve silver as a ghost but much more solid with a thatch of hair that complete ly covered his eyes Yes we acquired it in curious circumstances It was brought in by a young witch just before Chri stmas oh many years ago now She said she needed the gold badly well that much was obvious Covered in rags and pretty far alon g Going to have a baby see She said the locket had been Slytheri ns Well we hear that sort of story all the time Oh this was Merlins this was his favorite teapot but when I looked at it it had his mark all right and a few s i m p l e s p e l l s w e r e e n o u g h t o t e ll me the truth Of course that made it near enough priceless She didnt seem to have any idea how much it was worth Happy to get ten Galleons for it Best bargain we ever made Dumbledore gave the Pensieve an extravigorous shake and Caractacus Burke descended back into the swirling mass of memory from whence he had come He only gave her ten Galleons said Harry indignantly CHAPTER THIRTEEN 262 Caractacus Burke was not famed for his generosity said Dumbledore So we know that near the end of her pregnancy Merope was alone in London and in desperate need of gold desperate enough to sell her one and only valuable possession the locket that was one of Marvolos treasured family heirlooms But she could do magic said Harry impatiently She could have got food and everything for he rself by magic couldnt she Ah said Dumbledore perhaps she could But it is my belief I am guessing again bu t I am sure I am right that when her husband abandoned her Merope stopped using magic I do not think that she wa nted to be a witch any longer Of course it is also possible that her unrequ ited love and the attendant despair sapped her of her powers that can happen In any case as you are about to see Merope refused to raise her wand even to save her own life She wouldnt even st ay alive for her son Dumbledore raised his eyebrows Could you possibly be feeling sorry for Lord Voldemort No said Harry quickly but sh e had a choice didnt she not like my mother Your mother had a choice too said Dumbledore gently Yes Merope Riddle chose death in spit e of a son who needed her but do not judge her too harshly Har ry She was greatly weakened by long suffering and she never had yo ur mothers courage And now if you will stand Where are we going Harry asked as Dumbledore joined him at the front of the desk This time said Dumbledore we are going to enter my THE SECRET RIDDLE 263 memory I think you will fi nd it both rich in detail and satisfyingly accurate After you Harry Harry bent over the Pensieve his face broke the cool surface of the memory and then he was falling through darkness again Seconds later his feet hit firm ground he opened his eyes and found that he and Dumbledore were standing in a bustling oldfashioned London street There I am said Dumbledore brightly pointing ahead of them to a tall figure crossing the road in front of a horsedrawn milk cart This younger Albus Dumbledore s long hair and beard were auburn Having reached their side of the street he strode off along the pavement drawing many curi ous glances due to the flamboyantly cut suit of plum velv et that he was wearing Nice suit sir said Harry before he could stop himself but Dumbledore merely chuckled as th ey followed his younger self a short distance finally passing through a set of iron gates into a bare courtyard that fronted a rather grim square building surrounded by high railings He mounted the few steps leading to the front door and knocked once After a moment or two the door was opened by a scruffy girl wearing an apron Good afternoon I have an a ppointment with a Mrs Cole who I believe is the matron here Oh said the bewilderedlookin g girl taking in Dumbledores eccentric appearance Um just a mo MRS COLE she bellowed over her shoulder Harry heard a distant voice shou ting something in response The girl turned back to Dumbledo re Come in shes on er way CHAPTER THIRTEEN 264 Dumbledore stepped into a hallway tiled in black and white the whole place was shabby but spot lessly clean Harry and the older Dumbledore followed Before the front door had closed behind them a skinny harassedlooking woman came scurrying toward them She had a sharpfeatured face that appeared more anxious than unkind and she was talking over her shoulder to another aproned helper as she walked toward Dumbledore and take the iodine upstai rs to Martha Billy Stubbs has been picking his scabs and Eric Whalleys oozing all over his sheets chicken pox on top of ev erything else she said to nobody in particular and then he r eyes fell upon Dumbledore and she stopped dead in her tracks looking as astonished as if a giraffe had just crossed her threshold Good afternoon sa id Dumbledore holding out his hand Mrs Cole simply gaped My name is Albus Dumbledore I sent you a letter requesting an appointment and you very ki ndly invited me here today Mrs Cole blinked Apparently deciding that Dumbledore was not a hallucination she said fee bly Oh yes Well well then youd better come in to my room Yes She led Dumbledore into a small r oom that seemed part sitting room part office It was as shabby as the hallway and the furniture was old and mismatched She invite d Dumbledore to sit on a rickety chair and seated herself behi nd a cluttered desk eyeing him nervously I am here as I told you in my letter to discuss Tom Riddle and arrangements for his future said Dumbledore Are you family asked Mrs Cole THE SECRET RIDDLE 265 No I am a teacher said Dumb ledore I have come to offer Tom a place at my school What schools this then It is called Hogwarts said Dumbledore And how come youre interested in Tom We believe he has qualities we are looking for You mean hes won a scholarship How can he have done Hes never been entered for one Well his name has been down for our school since birth Who registered him His parents There was no doubt that Mrs Co le was an inconveniently sharp woman Apparently Dumbledore thought so too for Harry now saw him slip his wand out of the pocket of his velvet suit at the same time picking up a piece of perfectly blank paper from Mrs Coles desktop Here said Dumbledore waving his wand once as he passed her the piece of paper I think th is will make everything clear Mrs Coles eyes slid out of focu s and back again as she gazed intently at the blank paper for a moment That seems perfectly in order she said placidly handing it back Then her eyes fell upon a bottle of gin and two glasses that had certainly not been pres ent a few seconds before Er may I offer you a glass of gin she said in an extrarefined voice Thank you very much said Dumbledore beaming It soon became clear that Mrs Cole was no novice when it came to gin drinking Pouring both of them a generous measure she drained her own glass in one gulp Smacking her lips frankly she CHAPTER THIRTEEN 266 smiled at Dumbledore for the first time and he didnt hesitate to press his advantage I was wondering whether you could tell me anything of Tom Riddles history I think he wa s born here in the orphanage Thats right said Mrs Cole help ing herself to more gin I remember it clear as anything beca use Id just started here myself New Years Eve and bitter cold snowing you know Nasty night And this girl not much older than I was myself at the time came staggering up the front steps Well she wasnt the first We took her in and she had the baby within th e hour And she was dead in another hour Mrs Cole nodded impressively and took another generous gulp of gin Did she say anything before she died asked Dumbledore Anything about the boys father for instance Now as it happens she did said Mrs Cole who seemed to be rather enjoying herself now with the gin in her hand and an eager audience for her story I remember she said to me I hope he looks like his papa and I wont lie sh e was right to hope it because she was no beauty and then she told me he was to be named Tom for his father and Marvolo for her father yes I know funny name isnt it We wondered whet her she came from a circus and she said the boys surname was to be Riddle And she died soon after that without another word Well we named him just as she d said it seemed so important to the poor girl but no Tom no r Marvolo nor any kind of Riddle ever came looking for him nor any family at all so he stayed in the orphanage and hes been here ever since Mrs Cole helped herself almo st absentmindedly to another THE SECRET RIDDLE 267 healthy measure of gin Two pink spots had appeared high on her cheekbones Then she sa id Hes a funny boy Yes said Dumbledore I thought he might be He was a funny baby too He hardly ever cried you know And then when he got a little older he was odd Odd in what way aske d Dumbledore gently Well he But Mrs Cole pulled up short and there was nothing blurry or vague about the inquisitorial glan ce she shot Dumbledore over her gin glass Hes definitely got a place at your school you say Definitely said Dumbledore And nothing I say can change that Nothing said Dumbledore Youll be taking hi m away whatever Whatever repeated Dumbledore gravely She squinted at him as though deciding whether or not to trust him Apparently she decided she co uld because she said in a sudden rush He scares the other children You mean he is a bully asked Dumbledore I think he must be said Mrs Cole frowning slightly but its very hard to catch him at it There have been incidents Nasty things Dumbledore did not press her thou gh Harry could tell that he was interested She took yet anot her gulp of gi n and her rosy cheeks grew rosier still Billy Stubbss rabbit well Tom said he didnt do it and I dont see how he could have done bu t even so it didn t hang itself from the rafters did it CHAPTER THIRTEEN 268 I shouldnt think so no said Dumbledore quietly But Im jiggered if I know how he got up there to do it All I know is he and Billy had argued the day before And then Mrs Cole took another swig of gin slo pping a little over her chin this time on the summer outing we take them out you know once a year to the countryside or to the seaside well Amy Benson and Dennis Bishop were neve r quite right afterwards and all we ever got out of them was that theyd gone into a cave with Tom Riddle He swore theyd just gone exploring but something happened in there Im sure of it And well there have been a lot of things funny things She looked around at Dumbledore again and though her cheeks were flushed her gaze was steady I dont think many people will be sorry to see the back of him You understand Im sure that we will not be keeping him permanently said Dumbledore He will have to return here at the very least every summer Oh well thats better than a whack on the nose with a rusty poker said Mrs Cole with a slight hiccup She got to her feet and Harry was impressed to see that sh e was quite steady even though twothirds of the gin was now gone I s u p p o s e y o u d l i k e t o s e e him Very much said Dumb ledore risi ng too She led him out of her office and up the stone stairs calling out instructions and admonitions to he lpers and children as she passed The orphans Harry saw were all wearing the same kind of grayish tunic They looked reasonably wellcared for but there was no denying that this was a grim place in which to grow up Here we are said Mrs Cole as they turned off the second THE SECRET RIDDLE 269 landing and stopped outside the fi rst door in a long corridor She knocked twice and entered Tom Youve got a visitor T his is Mr Dumberton sorry Dunderbore Hes come to tell you well Ill let him do it Harry and the two Dumbledores entered the room and Mrs Cole closed the door on them It was a small bare room with nothing in it except an old wardrobe a wooden chair and an iron bedstead A boy was sitting on top of the gray blankets his legs stretched out in front of him holding a book There was no trace of the Gaunts in Tom Riddles face Merope had got her dying wish He was his handsome father in miniature tall for eleven years old darkhai red and pale His eyes narrowed slightly as he took in Dumbledo res eccentric appearance There was a moments silence How do you do Tom said Dumbledore walking forward and holding out his hand The boy hesitated then took it and they shook hands Dumbledore drew up the hard wooden chair beside Riddle so that the pair of them looked rather like a hospital patient and visitor I am Professor Dumbledore Professor repeated Riddle He looked wary Is that like doctor What are you here for Did she get you in to have a look at me He was pointing at the door through which Mrs Cole had just left No no said Dumbledore smiling I dont believe you said Riddl e She wants me looked at doesnt she Tell the truth He spoke the last three words with a ringing force that was CHAPTER THIRTEEN 270 almost shocking It was a command and it sounded as though he had given it many times before His eyes had widened and he was glaring at Dumbledore who made no response except to continue smiling pleasantly After a few seconds Riddle stopped glaring though he looked if an ything warier still Who are you I have told you My name is Professor Dumbledore and I work at a school called Hogwarts I have come to offer you a place at my school your new school if you would like to come Riddles reaction to this was most surprising He leapt from the bed and backed away from Du mbledore looking furious You cant kid me The asylum thats where youre from isnt it Professor yes of course well Im not going see That old cats the one who should be in the asylum I never did anything to little Amy Benson or Dennis Bishop and you can ask them theyll tell you I am not from the asylum sa id Dumbledore patiently I am a teacher and if you will sit down calmly I shall tell you about Hogwarts Of course if you would ra ther not come to the school nobody will force you Id like to see them try sneered Riddle Hogwarts Dumbledore went on as though he had not heard Riddles last words i s a school for people wi th special abilities Im not mad I know that you are not mad Ho gwarts is not a school for mad people It is a school of magic There was silence Riddle had froz en his face expressionless but his eyes were flickering back and forth between each of Dumbledores as though trying to catch one of them lying THE SECRET RIDDLE 271 Magic he repeat ed in a whisper Thats right said Dumbledore Its its magi c what I can do What is it that you can do All sorts breathed Riddle A flus h of excitement was rising up his neck into his hollow cheeks he looked fevered I can make things move without touching th em I can make animals do what I want them to do without traini ng them I can make bad things happen to people who annoy me I can make them hurt if I want to His legs were trembling He st umbled forward and sat down on the bed again staring at his hand s his head bowed as though in prayer I knew I was different he whispered to his own quivering fingers I knew I was special Alwa ys I knew there was something Well you were quite right said Dumbledore who was no longer smiling but wa tching Riddle intently You are a wizard Riddle lifted his head His face was transfigured There was a wild happiness upon it yet for so me reason it did not make him better looking on the contrary his finely carved features seemed somehow rougher his expression almost bestial Are you a wizard too Yes I am Prove it said Riddle at once in the same commanding tone he had used when he had said Tell the truth Dumbledore raised his eyebrows If as I take it you are accepting your place at Hogwarts Of course I am Then you will address me as Professor or sir CHAPTER THIRTEEN 272 Riddles expression hardened for the most fleeting moment before he said in an unrecognizably polite voice Im sorry sir I meant please Professor could you show me Harry was sure that Dumbledore was going to refuse that he would tell Riddle there would be plenty of time for practical demonstrations at Hogwarts that th ey were currently in a building full of Muggles and must therefore be cautious To his great surprise however Dumbledore drew his wand from an inside pocket of his suit jacket pointed it at the shabby wardrobe in the corner and gave the wand a casual flick The wardrobe burs t into flames Riddle jumped to his feet Harry could hardly blame him for howling in shock and rage all his worldly possessions must be in there But even as Riddle rounded on Dumbledore the flames vanished leaving the wardrobe completely undamaged Riddle stared from the wardrobe to Dumbledore then his expression greedy he pointed at th e wand Where ca n I get one of them A l l i n g o o d t i m e s a i d D u m b ledore I think there is something trying to get out of your wardrobe And sure enough a faint rattling could be heard from inside it For the first time Ridd le looked frightened Open the door sa id Dumbledore Riddle hesitated then crosse d the room and threw open the wardrobe door On the topmost shel f above a rail of threadbare clothes a small cardboard box was shaking and rattling as though there were several frantic mice trapped inside it Take it out said Dumbledore Riddle took down the quaking box He looked unnerved THE SECRET RIDDLE 273 Is there anything in that box that you ought not to have asked Dumbledore Riddle threw Dumbledore a long cl ear calculating look Yes I suppose so sir he said finally in an expressionless voice Open it said Dumbledore Riddle took off the lid and tipp ed the contents onto his bed without looking at them Harry who had expected something much more exciting saw a mess of sm all everyday objects a yoyo a silver thimble and a tarnishe d mouth organ among them Once free of the box they stopped quivering and lay quite still upon the thin blankets You will return them to their owners with your apologies said Dumbledore calmly putting his wand back into his jacket I shall know whether it has been done An d be warned Thieving is not tolerated at Hogwarts Riddle did not look remotely abashe d he was still staring coldly and appraisingly at Dumbledore At la st he said in a colorless voice Yes sir At Hogwarts Dumbledore went on we teach you not only to use magic but to control it You have inadvertently I am sure been using your powers in a way that is neither taught nor tolerated at our school You are not the first nor will you be the last to allow your magic to run away with you But you should know that Hogwarts can expel students and the Mi nistry of Magic yes there is a Ministry will punish lawbreak ers still more severely All new wizards must accept that in enter ing our world they abide by our laws Yes sir said Riddle again It was impossible to tell what he was thinking his face remained CHAPTER THIRTEEN 274 quite blank as he put the little cache of stolen objects back into the cardboard box When he had fini shed he turned to Dumbledore and said baldly I havent got any money That is easily remedied said Dumbledore drawing a leather moneypouch from his pocket There is a fund at Hogwarts for those who require assistance to buy books and robes You might have to buy some of your spellbooks and so on secondhand but Where do you buy spellbooks interrupted Riddle who had taken the heavy mone y bag without thanki ng Dumbledore and was now examining a fat gold Galleon In Diagon Alley said Dumbledore I have your list of books and school equipment with me I ca n help you find everything Youre coming with me asked Riddle looking up Certainly if you I dont need you said Riddle Im used to doing things for myself I go round London on my own all the time How do you get to this Diagon Alley sir he added catching Dumbledores eye Harry thought that Dumbledore would insist upon accompanying Riddle but once again he was surprised Dumbledore handed Riddle the envelope cont aining his list of equipment and after telling Riddle exactly how to get to the Leaky Cauldron from the orphanage he said You will be able to see it although Muggles around you nonmagical people that is will not Ask for Tom the barman easy enough to remember as he shares your name Riddle gave an irritable twitch as though trying to displace an irksome fly You dislike the name Tom THE SECRET RIDDLE 275 There are a lot of Toms mutte red Riddle Then as though he could not suppress the question as though it burst from him in spite of himself he asked Was my father a wizard He was called Tom Riddle too th eyve told me Im afraid I dont know said Dumbledore his voice gentle My mother cant have been magic or she wouldnt have died said Riddle more to himself th an Dumbledore It mustve been him So when Ive got all my stuff when do I come to this Hogwarts All the details are on the second piece of parchment in your envelope said Dumbledore You will leave from Kings Cross Station on the first of September Ther e is a train ticket in there too Riddle nodded Dumbledore got to his feet and held out his hand again Taking it Riddle said I can speak to snakes I found out when weve been to the country on trips they find me they whisper to me Is that normal for a wizard Harry could tell that he had wit hheld mention of this strangest power until that moment determined to impress It is unusual said Dumbledore after a moments hesitation but not unheard of His tone was casual but his eyes moved curiously over Riddles face They stood for a moment man an d boy staring at each other Then the handshake was broken Dumbledor e was at the door Goodbye Tom I shall see you at Hogwarts I think that will do said the whitehaired Dumbledore at Harrys side and seconds later they were soaring weightlessly through darkness once more before landing squarely in the presentday office Sit down said Dumbledore landing beside Harry CHAPTER THIRTEEN 276 Harry obeyed his mind still full of what he had just seen He believed it much quicker than I did I mean when you told him he was a wizard said Ha rry I didnt believe Hagrid at first when he told me Yes Riddle was perfectly ready to believe that he was to use his word special said Dumbledore Did you know then asked Harry Did I know that I had just me t the most dangerous Dark wizard of all time said Dumbledore No I had no idea that he was to grow up to be what he is Ho wever I was certainly intrigued by him I returned to Hogwarts intending to keep an eye upon him something I should have done in any case given that he was alone and friendless but which already I felt I ought to do for others sake as much as his His powers as you heard were surprisingly welldeveloped for such a young wizard and most interestingly and ominously of all he had already discovered th at he had some measure of control over them and begun to use them consciously And as you saw they were not the random experi ments typical of young wizards He was already using magic agains t other people to frighten to punish to control The little stories of the strangled rabbit and the young boy and girl he lured into a cave were most suggestive I can make them hurt if I want to And he was a Parselmouth interjected Harry Yes indeed a rare ability and one supposedly connected with the Dark Arts although as we kn ow there are Parselmouths among the great and the good too In fact his ability to speak to serpents did not make me nearly as uneasy as his obvious instincts for cruelty secrecy and domination THE SECRET RIDDLE 277 Time is making fools of us agai n said Dumbledore indicating the dark sky beyond the windows But before we part I want to draw your attention to certain feat ures of the sce ne we have just witnessed for they have a great be aring on the matters we shall be discussing in fu ture meetings Firstly I hope you noticed Riddles reaction when I mentioned that another sh ared his first name Tom Harry nodded There he showed his contempt for anything that tied him to other people anything that ma de him ordinary Even then he wished to be different separate notorious He shed his name as you know within a few short years of that conversation and created the mask of Lord Voldemort be hind which he has been hidden for so long I trust that you also noticed that Tom Riddle was already highly selfsufficient secretive and apparently friendless He did not want help or companionship on his trip to Diagon Alley He preferred to operate alone The adul t Voldemort is the same You will hear many of his Death Eaters clai ming that they are in his confidence that they alone are close to him even understand him They are deluded Lord Voldemort has never had a friend nor do I believe that he has ever wanted one And lastly I hope you are no t too sleepy to pay attention to this Harry the young Tom Riddle liked to collect trophies You saw the box of stolen articles he had hidden in his room These were taken from victims of his bu llying behavior souvenirs if you w i l l o f p a r t i c u l a r l y u n p l e a s a n t b i t s o f m a g i c B e a r i n m i n d t h i s magpielike tendency for this partic ularly will be important later And now it really is time for bed CHAPTER THIRTEEN 278 Harry got to his feet As he walk ed across the room his eyes fell upon the little table on which Marv olo Gaunts ring had rested last time but the ring wa s no longer there Yes Harry said Dumbledore for Harry had come to a halt The rings gone said Harry looking around But I thought you might have the mout h organ or something Dumbledore beamed at him peering over the top of his halfmoon spectacles Very astute Harry but the mouth organ was only ever a mouth organ And on that enigmatic note he waved to Harry who understood himself to be dismissed F O U R T E E N 279 FELIX FELICIS arry had Herbology first thin g the following morning He had been unable to tell Ron and Hermione about his lesson with Dumbledore over breakfast for fear of being overheard but he filled them in as they walked across the vegetable patch toward the greenhouses The weekends brutal wind had died out at last the weird mist had returned and it took them a little longer than usual to find the correct greenhouse Wow scary thought the boy YouKnowWho said Ron quietly as they took their places ar ound one of the gnarled Snargaluff stumps that formed this terms project and began pulling on their protective gloves But I still dont get why Dumbledores showing you all this I mean its really interesting and everything but whats the point Dunno said Harry inserting a gu m shield But he says its all important and itll help me survive I think its fascinating said Hermione earnestly It makes H CHAPTER FOURTEEN 280 absolute sense to know as much about Voldemort as possible How else will you find out his weaknesses So how was Slughorns latest party Harry asked her thickly through the gum shield Oh it was quite fun really said Hermione now putting on protective goggles I mean he dr ones on about famous expupils a bit and he absolutely fawns on McLaggen because hes so wellconnected but he gave us some really nice food and he introduced us to Gwenog Jones Gwenog Jones said Ron his eyes widening under his own goggles The Gwenog Jones Captain of the Holyhead Harpies Thats right said Hermione P ersonally I thought she was a bit full of herself but Quite enough chat over here said Professor Sprout briskly bustling over and looking stern Youre lagging behind everybody else has started and Nevilles already got hi s first pod They looked around sure enoug h there sat Neville with a bloody lip and several nasty scratche s along the side of his face but clutching an unpleasantly pulsating green object about the size of a grapefruit Okay Professor were starting now said Ron adding quietly when she had turned away again shouldve used Muffliato Harry No we shouldnt said Hermione at once looking as she always did intensely cross at the thought of the HalfBlood Prince and his spells Well come on wed better get going She gave the other two an apprehen sive look they all took deep breaths and then dived at th e gnarled stump between them It sprang to life at once long prickly bramblelike vines flew out of the top and whipped through th e air One tangled itself in FELIX FELICIS 281 Hermiones hair and Ron beat it b a c k w i t h a p a i r o f s e c a t e u r s Harry succeeded in trappi ng a couple of vines and knotting them together a hole opened in the middle of all the tentaclelike branches Hermione plunged her ar m bravely into this hole which closed like a trap around he r elbow Harry and Ron tugged and wrenched at the vines forcing the hole to open again and Hermione snatched her arm free clutching in her fingers a pod just like Nevilles At once the prickly vi nes shot back inside and the gnarled stump sat there looking like an innocently dead lump of wood You know I dont think Ill be having any of these in my garden when Ive got my own place said Ron pushing his goggles up onto his forehead and wipi ng sweat from his face Pass me a bowl said Hermione holding the pulsating pod at arms length Harry handed one ov er and she dropped the pod into it with a look of disgust on her face Dont be squeamish squeeze it out theyre best when theyre fresh called Professor Sprout Anyway said Hermione contin uing their interrupted conversation as though a lump of wood had not just attacked them Slughorns going to have a Christ mas party Harry and theres no way youll be able to wriggle out of this one because he actually asked me to check your free evenings so he could be sure to have it on a night you can come Harry groaned Meanwhile Ron who was attempting to burst the pod in the bowl by putting bo th hands on it standing up and squashing it as hard as he could said angrily And this is another party just for Slughorns favorites is it Just for the Slug Club yes said Hermione CHAPTER FOURTEEN 282 The pod flew out from under Rons fingers and hit the greenhouse glass rebounding onto the back of Professor Sprouts head and knocking off her old patched hat Harry went to retrieve the pod when he got back He rmione was saying Look I didnt make up the name Slug Club Slug Club repeated Ron with a sneer worthy of Malfoy Its pathetic Well I hope you enjoy your party Why dont you try hooking up with McLaggen then Slughorn can make you King and Queen Slug Were allowed to bring guests said Hermione who for some reason had turned a bright boiling scarlet and I was going to ask you to come but if you think its that stupid then I wont bother Harry suddenly wished the pod had flown a little farther so that he need not have been sitting here with the pair of them Unnoticed by either he seized the bo wl that contained the pod and began to try and open it by the nois iest and most energetic means he could think of unfortunately he could still hear every word of their conversation You were going to ask me as ked Ron in a completely different voice Yes said Hermione angrily B ut obviously if youd rather I hooked up with McLaggen There was a pause while Harry cont inued to pound the resilient pod with a trowel No I wouldnt said Ron in a very quiet voice Harry missed the pod hit the bowl and shattered it Reparo he said hastily poking the pieces with his wand and the bowl sprang back together agai n The crash however appeared to have awoken Ron and Hermione to Harrys presence Hermione FELIX FELICIS 283 looked flustered and immediatel y started fussing about for her copy of FleshEating Trees of the World to find out the correct way to juice Snargaluff pods Ron on the other hand looked sheepish but also rather pl eased with himself Hand that over Harry said He rmione hurriedly It says were supposed to puncture them wi th something sharp Harry passed her the pod in the bo wl he and Ron both snapped their goggles back over their eyes and dived once more for the stump It was not as though he was rea lly surprised th ought Harry as he wrestled with a thorny vine int ent upon throttling him he had had an inkling that this might happen sooner or later But he was not sure how he felt about it He and Cho were now too embarrassed to look at each other let alone talk to each other what if Ron and Hermione started going out together then split up Could their friendship survive it Harry remembered the few weeks when they had not been talking to each other in the third year he had not enjoyed trying to bridge the distance between them And then what if they didnt split up What if they became like Bill and Fleur and it became excruciatingly embarrassing to be in their presence so that he was shut out for good Gotcha yelled Ron pulling a se cond pod from the stump just as Hermione managed to burst the first one open so that the bowl was full of tubers wrigglin g like pale green worms The rest of the lesson passed without further mention of Slughorns party Although Harr y watched his two friends more closely over the next few days Ron and Hermione did not seem any different except that they were a little politer to each other than usual Harry supposed he would ju st have to wait to see what CHAPTER FOURTEEN 284 happened under the influence of bu tterbeer in Slughorns dimly lit room on the night of the party In the meantime however he had more pressing worries Katie Bell was still in St Mungos Hospital with no prospect of leaving which meant that the promising Gryffindor team Harry had been training so carefully since September was one Chaser short He kept putting off replac ing Katie in the hope that she would return but their opening ma tch against Slytherin was looming and he finally had to accept th at she would not be back in time to play Harry did not think he could st and another fullHouse tryout With a sinking feeling that had little to do with Quidditch he cornered Dean Thomas after Transfig uration one day Most of the class had already left although se veral twittering yellow birds were still zooming around the room all of Hermiones creation nobody else had succeeded in conjuring so much as a feather from thin air Are you still interested in playing Chaser Wha Yeah of course said Dean excitedly Over Deans shoulder Harry saw Seamus Finnigan slamming his books into his bag looking sour One of the reasons why Harry would have preferred not to have to ask Dean to play was that he knew Seamus would not like it On the other ha nd he had to do what was best for the team and Dean had outflown Seamus at the tryouts Well then youre in said Harry Theres a practice tonight seven oclock Right said Dean Cheers Harr y Blimey I cant wait to tell Ginny He sprinted out of the room leaving Harry and Seamus alone together an uncomfortable moment made no easier when a bird FELIX FELICIS 285 dropping landed on Seamuss head as one of Hermiones canaries whizzed over them Seamus was not the only person disgruntled by the choice of Katies substitute There was much muttering in the common room about the fact that Harry had now chosen two of his classmates for the team As Harry had endured much worse mutterings than this in his school career he was not particularly bothered but all the same the pressure was increasing to provide a win in the upcoming match against Slythe rin If Gryffindor won Harry knew that the whole House would fo rget that they had criticized him and swear that they had always known it was a great team If they lost well Harry thought wryly he had still endured worse mutterings Harry had no reason to regret his choice once he saw Dean fly that evening he worked well with Ginny and Demelza The Beaters Peakes and Coote were getti ng better all the time The only problem was Ron Harry had known all along that Ro n was an inconsistent player who suffered from nerves and a lack of confidence and unfortunately the looming prospect of the opening game of the season seemed to have brought out all his old insecurities After letting in half a dozen goals most of them scored by Ginny his technique became wilder and wilder until he finally punched an oncoming Demelza Robins in the mouth It was an accident Im sorry Demelza really sorry Ron shouted after her as she zigzagge d back to the ground dripping blood everywhere I just Panicked Ginny said angrily landing next to Demelza and examining her fat lip Y ou prat Ron look at the state of her CHAPTER FOURTEEN 286 I can fix that said Harry landing beside the two girls pointing his wand at Demelzas mouth and saying Episkey And Ginny dont call Ron a prat youre no t the Captain of this team Well you seemed too busy to call him a prat and I thought someone should Harry forced himself not to laugh In the air everyone lets go Overall it was one of the worst practices they had had all term though Harry did not feel that honesty was the best policy when they were this cl ose to the match Good work everyone I think wel l flatten Slytherin he said bracingly and the Chasers and Be aters left the changing room looking reasonably happy with themselves I played like a sack of dragon dung said Ron in a hollow voice when the door had swun g shut behind Ginny No you didnt said Harry fi rmly Youre the best Keeper I tried out Ron Your only problem is nerves He kept up a relentless flow of encouragement all the way back to the castle and by the time they reached the second floor Ron was looking marginally more ch eerful When Harry pushed open the tapestry to take their usual shortcut up to Gryffindor Tower however they found themselves looking at Dean and Ginny who were locked in a close embrace and kissing fiercely as though glued together It was as though something large and scaly erupted into life in Harrys stomach clawing at his in sides Hot blood seemed to flood his brain so that all thought was extinguished replaced by a savage urge to jinx Dean into a jelly Wrestling with this sudden madness he heard Rons voice as though from a great distance away FELIX FELICIS 287 Oi Dean and Ginny broke apart and looked around What said Ginny I dont want to find my own sist er snogging people in public This was a deserted corridor ti ll you came butting in said Ginny Dean was looking embarrassed He gave Harry a shifty grin that Harry did not return as the newborn monster inside him was roaring for Deans instant dismissal from the team Er cmon Ginny said Dean lets go back to the common room You go said Ginny I want a word with my dear brother Dean left looking as though he was not sorry to depart the scene Right said Ginny tossing her long red hair out of her face and glaring at Ron lets get this straig ht once and for all It is none of your business who I go out with or what I do with them Ron Yeah it is said Ron just as angrily Dyou think I want people saying my sisters a A what shouted Ginny drawing her wand A what exactly He doesnt mean anything Gi nny said Harry automatically though the monster was roarin g its approval of Rons words Oh yes he does she said flar ing up at Harry Just because hes never snogged anyone in his life just because the best kiss hes ever had is from our Auntie Muriel Shut your mouth bellowed Ro n bypassing red and turning maroon No I will not yelled Ginny besi de herself Ive seen you with Phlegm hoping shell kiss you on th e cheek every time you see her CHAPTER FOURTEEN 288 its pathetic If you went out an d got a bit of sn ogging done yourself you wouldnt mind so much that everyone else does it Ron had pulled out his wand t oo Harry stepped swiftly between them You dont know what youre ta lking about Ron roared trying to get a clear shot at Ginny arou nd Harry who was now standing in front of her with his arms outs tretched Just because I dont do it in public Ginny screamed with derisive la ughter trying to push Harry out of the way Been kissing Pigwidgeon have yo u Or have you got a picture of Auntie Muriel stashe d under your pillow You A streak of orange light flew under Harrys left arm and missed Ginny by inches Harry pushed Ron up against the wall Dont be stupid Harrys snogged Cho Chang shouted Ginny who sounded close to tears now And Hermione snogged Viktor Krum its only you who acts like its something disgusting Ron and thats because youve got about as much experience as a twelveyearold And with that she stormed away Harry quickly let go of Ron the look on his face was murderous They both stood there breathing heavily until Mrs Norris Filc hs cat appeared around the corner which broke the tension Cmon said Harry as the sound of Filchs shuffling feet reached their ears They hurried up the stairs an d along a seventhfloor corridor Oi out of the way Ron barked at a small girl who jumped in fright and dropped a bottle of toadspawn FELIX FELICIS 289 Harry hardly noticed the sound of shattering glass he felt disoriented dizzy being struck by a lightning bolt must be something like this Its just because shes Rons sister he told himself You just didnt like seeing her kissing Dean because shes Rons sister B u t u n b i d d e n i n t o h i s m i n d c a m e a n i m a g e o f t h a t s a m e d e serted corridor with himself kissing Ginny in stead The monster in his chest purred bu t then he saw Ron ripping open the tapestry curtain and drawing his wa nd on Harry shouting things like betrayal of trust supposed to be my friend Dyou think Hermione did snog Krum Ron asked abruptly as they approached the Fat Lady Harry gave a guilty start and wrenched his imagination away fr om a corridor in which no Ron intruded in which he and Ginny were quite alone What he said confused ly Oh er The honest answer was yes bu t he did not want to give it However Ron seemed to gather the worst from the look on Harrys face Dilligrout he said darkly to the Fat Lady and they climbed through the portrait hole into the common room Neither of them mentioned Ginn y or Hermione again indeed they barely spoke to each other th at evening and got into bed in silence each absorbed in his own thoughts Harry lay awake for a long time l ooking up at the canopy of his fourposter and trying to convince himself that his feelings for Ginny were entirely elderbrotherly They had lived had they not like brother and sister all summer playing Quidditch teasing Ron and having a laugh about Bill an d Phlegm He had known Ginny for years now It was natural th at he should feel protective natural that he should want to look out for her want to rip CHAPTER FOURTEEN 290 Dean limb from limb for kissing her No he would have to control that particular brotherly feeling Ron gave a great grunting snore Shes Rons sister Harry told himself firmly Rons sister Shes outofbounds He would not risk his friend ship with Ron for anything He punched his pillow into a more comfortable shape and waited for sleep to come trying his utmost not to allow his thoughts to stray anywhere near Ginny Harry awoke next morning feeling slightly dazed and confused by a series of dreams in which Ron had chased him with a Beaters bat but by midday he would ha ve happily exchanged the dream Ron for the real one who was no t only coldsho uldering Ginny and Dean but also treating a hu rt and bewildered Hermione with an icy sneering indifference What was more Ron seemed to have become overnight as touchy and ready to lash out as the average BlastEnded Skrewt Harry spent th e day attempting to keep the peace between Ron and Hermione with no success finally Hermione departed for bed in high dudgeon and Ron stalked off to the boys dormitory after swearing angr ily at several frightened first years for look ing at him To Harrys dismay Rons new aggression did not wear off over the next few days Worse still it coinci ded with an even deeper dip in his Keeping skills which made him still more aggressive so that during the final Quidditch practice before Saturdays match he failed to save every single goal the Chaser s aimed at him but bellowed at everybody so much that he reduced Demelza Robins to tears You shut up and leave her alo ne shouted Peakes who was about twothirds Rons height though admittedly carrying a heavy bat FELIX FELICIS 291 ENOUGH bellowed Harry wh o had seen Gi nny glowering in Rons direction and remember ing her reputation as an accomplished caster of the BatBogey He x soared over to intervene before things got out of hand Peake s go and pack up the Bludgers Demelza pull yourself together you played really well today Ron he waited until the rest of the team were out of earshot before saying it your e my best mate but carry on treating the rest of them like this and Im goin g to kick you off the team He really thought for a moment that Ron might hit him but then something much worse happened Ro n seemed to sag on his broom all the fight went out of him and he said I resign Im pathetic Youre not pathetic and youre not resigning said Harry fiercely seizing Ron by the front of his robes You can save anything when youre on form its a mental problem youve got You calling me mental Yeah maybe I am They glared at each other for a moment then Ron shook his head wearily I know you haven t got any time to find another Keeper so Ill play tomorrow but if we lose and we will Im taking myself off the team Nothing Harry said made any difference He tried boosting Rons confidence all through dinn er but Ron was too busy being grumpy and surly with Hermione to notice Harry persisted in the common room that evening but his assertion that the whole team would be devastated if Ro n left was somewhat undermined by the fact that the rest of the team was sitting in a huddle in a distant corner clearly muttering about Ron and casting him nasty looks Finally Harry tried ge tting angry again in the hope CHAPTER FOURTEEN 292 of provoking Ron into a defian t and hopefully goalsaving attitude but this strategy did no t appear to work any better than encouragement Ron went to bed as dejected and hopeless as ever Harry lay awake for a very long time in the darkness He did not want to lose the upcoming match not only was it his first as Captain but he was determined to beat Draco Malfoy at Quidditch even if he could not yet prove his suspicions about him Yet if Ron played as he had done in the last few practices their chances of winning were ve ry slim If only there was something he could do to make Ron pull himself together make him play at the top of his form something that would ensure that Ron had a rea lly good day And the answer came to Harry in one sudden glorious stroke of inspiration Breakfast was the usual excita ble affair next morning the Slytherins hissed and booed loudly as every member of the Gryffindor team entered the Great Hall Harry glanced at the ceiling and saw a clear pale bl ue sky a good omen The Gryffindor table a solid ma ss of red and gold cheered as Harry and Ron approached Harry grinned and waved Ron grimaced weakly and shook his head Cheer up Ron called Lavender I know youll be brilliant Ron ignored her Tea Harry asked him Coffee Pumpkin juice Anything said Ron glumly ta king a moody bite of toast A few minutes later Hermione who had become so tired of Rons recent unpleasant behavior that she had not come down to breakfast with them paused on her way up the table FELIX FELICIS 293 How are you both feeling she asked tentatively her eyes on the back of Rons head Fine said Harry who was co ncentrating on handing Ron a glass of pumpkin juice The re you go Ron Drink up Ron had just raised the glass to his lips when Hermione spoke sharply Dont drink that Ron Both Harry and Ron lo oked up at her Why not said Ron Hermione was now staring at Harry as though she could not believe her eyes You just put something in that drink Excuse me said Harry You heard me I saw you You ju st tipped something into Rons drink Youve got the bottle in your hand right now I dont know what youre talk ing about said Harry stowing the little bottle ha stily in his pocket Ron I warn you don t drink it Herm ione said again alarmed but Ron picked up the glass drained it in one gulp and said Stop bossing me around Hermione She looked scandalized Bending low so that only Harry could hear her she hissed You should be expelled for that Id never have believed it of you Harry Hark whos talking he whis pered back Confunded anyone lately She stormed up the table away from them Harry watched her go without regret Hermione had never really understood what a serious business Quidditch was He then looked around at Ron who was smacking his lips CHAPTER FOURTEEN 294 Nearly time said Harry blithely The frosty grass crunched underf oot as they strode down to the stadium Pretty lucky the weat hers this good eh Harry asked Ron Yeah said Ron who was pale and sicklooking Ginny and Demelza were already wearing their Quidditch robes and waiting in the changing room Conditions look ideal said Gi nny ignoring Ron And guess what That Slytherin Chaser Vais ey he took a Bludger in the head yesterday during their practice and hes too sore to play And even better than that Ma lfoys gone o ff sick too What said Harry wheeling around to stare at her Hes ill Whats wrong with him No idea but its great for us said Ginny brightly Theyre playing Harper instead hes in my year and hes an idiot Harry smiled back vaguely but as he pulled on his scarlet robes his mind was far from Quidditch Malfoy had once before claimed he could not play due to injury but on that occasion he had made sure the whole match was reschedu led for a time that suited the Slytherins better Why was he now happy to let a substitute go on Was he really ill or was he faking Fishy isnt it he said in an undertone to Ron Malfoy not playing Lucky I call it said Ron looking slightly more animated And Vaisey off too hes their be st goal scorer I didnt fancy hey he said suddenly freezing halfway through pulling on his Keepers gloves and staring at Harry What FELIX FELICIS 295 I you Ron had dropped his voice he looked both scared and excited My drink my pumpkin juice you didnt Harry raised his eyebrows but sa id nothing except Well be starting in about five minutes youd better get your boots on They walked out onto the pitch to tumultuous roars and boos One end of the stadium was solid re d and gold the other a sea of green and silver Many Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws had taken sides too Amidst all the yelling and cl apping Harry could distinctly hear the roar of Luna Lovegoods famous liontopped hat Harry stepped up to Madam Hooch the referee who was standing ready to release the balls from the crate Captains shake hands she said and Harry had his hand crushed by the new Slytherin Ca ptain Urquhart Mount your brooms On the whistle th ree two one The whistle sounded Harry and the others kicked off hard from the frozen ground an d they were away Harry soared around the perime ter of the grounds looking around for the Snitch and keep ing one eye on Harper who was zigzagging far below him Then a voice that was jarringly different to the usual commen tators started up Well there they go and I think were all surprised to see the team that Potters put together this year Many thought given Ronald Weasleys patchy performanc e as Keeper last year that he might be off the team but of cour se a close personal friendship with the Captain does help These words were greeted with jeers and applause from the Slytherin end of the pitch Harry craned around on his broom to CHAPTER FOURTEEN 296 look toward the commentators p odium A tall skinny blond boy with an upturned nose was standing there talking into the magical megaphone that had once been Lee Jordans Harry recognized Zacharias Smith a Hufflepuff play er whom he heartily disliked Oh and here comes Slytherin s first attempt on goal its Urquhart streaking do wn the pitch and Harrys stomach turned over Weasley saves it well hes bound to get lucky sometimes I suppose Thats right Smith he is mu ttered Harry grinning to himself as he dived amongst the Chas ers with his eyes searching all around for some hint of the elusive Snitch With half an hour of the game gone Gryffindor were leading sixty points to zero Ron having ma de some truly spectacular saves some by the very tips of his gloves and Ginny having scored four of Gryffindors six goals This ef fectively stopped Zacharias wondering loudly whether the two Weasleys were only there because Harry liked them and he started on Peakes and Coote instead Of course Coote isnt really the usual build for a Beater said Zacharias loftily theyve gene rally got a bit more muscle Hit a Bludger at him Harry called to Coote as he zoomed past but Coote grinni ng broadly chose to aim the next Bludger at Harper instead who was just passing Harry in the opposite direction Harry was pleased to hear the dull thunk that meant the Bludger had found its mark It seemed as though Gryffindor could do no wrong Again and again they scored and again and again at the other end of the pitch Ron saved goals with appare nt ease He was actually smiling now and when the crowd greeted a particularly good save with a FELIX FELICIS 297 rousing chorus of the old favorite Weasley Is Our King he pretended to conduct them from on high Thinks hes something special t oday doesnt he said a snide voice and Harry was nearly knocke d off his broom as Harper collided with him hard an d deliberately Your bl oodtraitor pal Madam Hoochs back was turned and though Gryffindors below shouted in anger by the time she looked around Harper had already sped off His shoulder aching Harry raced after him determined to ram him back And I think Harper of Slythe rins seen the Snitch said Zacharias Smith through his megaph one Yes hes certainly seen something Potter hasnt Smith really was an idiot though t Harry hadnt he noticed them collide But next moment his stomach seemed to drop out of the sky Smith was right and Harry wa s wrong Harper had not sped upward at random he had spotted what Harry had not The Snitch was speeding along high above them glinting brightly against the clear blue sky Harry accelerated the wind was whis tling in his ears so that it drowned all sound of Smiths commentary or the crowd but Harper was still ahead of him an d Gryffindor was only a hundred points up if Harper got there first Gryffindor had lost and now Harper was feet from it hi s hand outstretched Oi Harper yelled Harry in desperation How much did Malfoy pay you to come on instead of him He did not know what made him say it but Harper did a doubletake he fumbled the Snitch let it slip through his fingers and shot right past it Harry made a great swipe for the tiny fluttering ball and caught it CHAPTER FOURTEEN 298 YES Harry yelled Wheeling ar ound he hurtled back toward the ground the Snitch held high in his hand As the crowd realized what had happened a great shout went up that almost drowned the sound of the whistle that signaled the end of the game Ginny wherere you going yelled Harry who had found himself trapped in the midst of a mass midair hug with the rest of the team but Ginny sped right on past them until with an almighty crash she collided with the comm entators podium As the crowd shrieked and laughed the Gryffindor team landed beside the wreckage of wood under which Za charias was feeb ly stirring Harry heard Ginny saying blithely to an irate Professor McGonagall Forgot to brak e Professor sorry Laughing Harry broke free of the rest of the team and hugged Ginny but let go very quickly Avoiding her gaze he clapped a cheering Ron on the back instead as all enmity forgotten the Gryffindor team left the pitch arm in arm punching the air and waving to their supporters The atmosphere in the chan ging room was jubilant Party up in the common room Seamus said yelled Dean exuberantly Cmon Ginny Demelza Ron and Harry were the last two in the changing room They were just about to leave when He rmione entered She was twisting her Gryffindor scarf in her hands and looked upset but determined I want a word with you Harry She took a deep breath You shouldnt have done it You he ard Slughorn its illegal What are you going to do tu rn us in demanded Ron What are you two talking about asked Harry turning away to hang up his robes so that neither of them would see him grinning You know perfectly well what were talking about said HermiFELIX FELICIS 299 one shrilly You spiked Rons juice with lucky potion at breakfast Felix Felicis No I didnt said Harry turn ing back to face them both Yes you did Harry and thats wh y everything went right there were Slytherin play ers missing and Ron saved everything I didnt put it in said Harry grinning broadly He slipped his hand inside his jacket pocket an d drew out the tiny bottle that Hermione had seen in his hand that morning It was full of golden potion and the cork was still tigh tly sealed with wax I wanted Ron to think Id done it so I faked it when I knew you were looking He looked at Ron You saved everything because you felt lucky You did it all yourself He pocketed the potion again There really wasnt anything in my pumpkin ju ice Ron said astounded But the weathers good and Vaisey couldnt play I honestly havent be en given lucky potion Harry shook his head Ron gaped at him for a moment then rounded on Hermione imitating her voice You added Felix Felicis to Rons juice this morning thats why he saved everything See I can save goals without help Hermione I never said you couldnt Ron you thought youd been given it too But Ron had already strode past her out of the door with his broomstick over his shoulder Er said Harry into the sudden si lence he had not expected his plan to backfire like this shall shall we go up to the party then You go said Hermione blinking back tears Im sick of Ron at the moment I dont know what Im supposed to have done CHAPTER FOURTEEN 300 And she stormed out of th e changing room too Harry walked slowly back up th e grounds toward the castle through the crowd many of whom shouted congratulations at him but he felt a great sense of le tdown he had been sure that if Ron won the match he and Herm ione would be friends again immediately He did not see how he could possibly explain to Hermione that what she had done to offend Ron was kiss Viktor Krum not when the offense had occurred so long ago Harry could not see Hermione at the Gryffindor celebration party which was in full swing wh en he arrived Renewed cheers and clapping greeted his appearan ce and he was soon surrounded by a mob of people congratulating him What with trying to shake off the Creevey brothers who wanted a blowbyblow match analysis and the large group of girl s that encircled him laughing at his least amusing comments and batti ng their eyelids it was some time before he could try and find Ron At last he extricated himself from Romilda Vane who was hinting heavily that she would like to go to Slughorns Christma s party with him As he was ducking toward the drinks table he wa lked straight into Ginny Arnold the Pygmy Puff riding on her sh oulder and Crookshanks mewing hopefully at her heels Looking for Ron she asked smirking Hes over there the filthy hypocrite Harry looked into the corner she was indicating There in full view of the whole room stood Ro n wrapped so closely around Lavender Brown it wa s hard to tell whos e hands were whose It looks like hes eating her face doesnt it said Ginny dispassionately But I suppose hes go t to refine his technique somehow Good game Harry FELIX FELICIS 301 She patted him on the arm Harry felt a swooping sensation in his stomach but then she wa lked off to help hers elf to more butterbeer Crookshanks trotted afte r her his yellow eyes fixed upon Arnold Harry turned away from Ron wh o did not look like he would be surfacing soon just as the portra it hole was closing With a sinking feeling he thought he saw a mane of bushy brown hair whipping out of sight He darted forward sidestepped Romilda Vane again and pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady The corridor outside seemed to be deserted Hermione He found her in the first unlocked classroom he tried She was sitting on the teachers desk alone except for a small ring of twittering yellow birds circling her head which she had clearly just conjured out of midair Harry could not help admiring her spellwork at a time like this Oh hello Harry she sa id in a brittle voice I was just practicing Yeah theyre er real ly good said Harry H e h a d n o i d e a w h a t t o s a y t o h e r H e w a s j u s t w o n d e r i n g whether there was any chance that she had not noticed Ron that she had merely left the room be cause the party was a little too rowdy when she said in an unnaturally highpitched voice Ron seems to be enjoying the celebrations Er does he said Harry Dont pretend you didnt see hi m said Hermione He wasnt exactly hiding it was The door behind them burst open To Harrys horror Ron came in laughing pulling La vender by the hand CHAPTER FOURTEEN 302 Oh he said drawing up short at the sight of Harry and Hermione Oops said Lavender and she backed out of the room giggling The door swung shut behind her There was a horrible swelling billowing silence Hermione was staring at Ron who refused to look a t h e r b u t s a i d w i t h a n o d d mixture of bravado and awkwardn ess Hi Harry Wondered where youd got to Hermione slid off the desk The little flock of golden birds continued to twitter in circles around her head so that she looked like a strange feathery mode l of the solar system You shouldnt leave Lavender wait ing outside she said quietly Shell wonder where youve gone She walked very slowly and erectly toward the door Harry glanced at Ron who wa s looking relieved th at nothing worse had happened Oppugno came a shriek from the doorway Harry spun around to see Hermione pointing her wand at Ron her expression wild The little floc k of birds was speeding like a hail of fat golden bullets toward Ron who yelped and covered his face with his hands but the birds attacked pecking and clawing at every bit of flesh they could reach Gerremoffme he yell ed but with one last look of vindictive fury Hermione wrenched open the door and disappeared through it Harry thought he heard a sob before it slammed F I F T E E N 303 THE UNBREAK ABLE VOW now was swirling against the ic y windows once more Christmas was approaching fast Hagrid had already singlehandedly delivered the usual twelve Christmas trees for the Great Hall garlands of holly and tinsel had been twisted around the banisters of the stairs everlasting candles glow ed from inside the helmets of suits of armor and great bunches of mistletoe had been hung at intervals along the corridors Large grou ps of girls tended to converge underneath the mistle toe bunches every time Harry went past which caused blockages in the co rridors fortunately however Harrys frequent nighttime wanderin gs had given him an unusually good knowledge of the castles secr et passageways so that he was able without too much difficulty to navigate mistletoefree routes between classes Ron who might once have found the necessity of these detours a cause for jealousy rather than hil arity simply roared with laughter about it all Although Harry mu ch preferred this new laughing S CHAPTER FIFTEEN 304 joking Ron to the moody aggres sive model he had been enduring for the last few weeks the improv ed Ron came at a heavy price Firstly Harry had to put up with the frequent pr esence of Lavender Brown who seemed to regard any moment that she was not kissing Ron as a moment wasted and secondly Harry found himself once more the best friend of two people who seemed unlikely ever to speak to each other again Ron whose hands and forearms still bore scratches and cuts from Hermiones bird attack was taking a defensive and resentful tone She cant complain he told Harry She snogged Krum So shes found out someone wants to snog me too Well its a free country I havent done anything wrong Harry did not answer but pretended to be absorbed in the book they were supposed to have re ad before Charms next morning Quintessence A Quest Determined as he was to remain friends with both Ron and Hermione he was spending a lot of time with his mouth shut tight I never promised Hermione anything Ron mumbled I mean all right I was going to go to Slughorns Christmas party with her but she never said just as friends Im a free agent Harry turned a page of Quintessence aware that Ron was watching him Rons voice tailed away in mutters barely audible over the loud crackling of the fire thou gh Harry thought he caught the words Krum and can t complain again Hermiones schedule was so full that Harry could only talk to her properly in the evenings when Ron was in any case so tightly THE UNBREAKABLE VOW 305 wrapped around Lavender that he did not notice what Harry was doing Hermione refused to sit in the common room while Ron was there so Harry generally joined her in the library which meant that their conversations were held in whispers Hes at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes said Hermione while the librarian Madam Pince prowled the shelves behind them I really couldnt care less She raised her quill and dotted an i so ferociously that she punctured a hole in her parchment Ha rry said nothing He thought his voice might soon vanish from lack of use He bent a little lower over Advanced PotionMaking and continued to make notes on Everlasting Elixirs occasionally pausing to decipher the Princes useful additions to Libatius Borages text And incidentally said Hermio ne after a few moments you need to be careful For the last time said Harry speaking in a slightly hoarse whisper after threequarters of an hour of silence I am not giving back this book Ive learned more from the HalfBlood Prince than Snape or Slughorn have taught me in Im not talking about your stup id socalled Prince said Hermione giving his book a nasty look as though it had been rude to her Im talking about earlier I w ent into the girls bathroom just before I came in here and there were about a dozen girls in there including that Romilda Vane trying to decide how to slip you a love potion Theyre all hoping th eyre going to get you to take them to Slughorns party and they all seem to have bought Fred and Georges love potions which Im afraid to say probably work CHAPTER FIFTEEN 306 Why didnt you confiscate th em then demanded Harry It seemed extraordinary that Herm iones mania for upholding rules could have abandoned her at this crucial juncture They didnt have the potions with them in the bathroom said Hermione scornfully They were just discussing tactics As I doubt whether even the HalfBlood Prince she gave th e book another nasty look could dream up an antidote for a dozen different love potions at once Id just invite someone to go with you thatll stop all the others thinking theyv e still got a chan ce Its tomorrow night theyre getting desperate There isnt anyone I want to invite mumbled Harry who was still trying not to think about Ginny any more than he could help despite the fact that sh e kept cropping up in his dreams in ways that made him devoutly thankf ul that Ron could not perform Legilimency Well just be careful what you drink because Romilda Vane looked like she meant busine ss said Hermione grimly She hitched up the long roll of parchment on which she was writing her Arithmancy essay and continued to scratch away with her quill Harry watc hed her with his mind a long way away Hang on a moment he said slowly I thought Filch had banned anything bought at Weasleys Wizard Wheezes And when has anyone ever paid attention to what Filch has banned asked Hermione still concentrating on her essay But I thought all the owls were being searched So how come these girls are able to bring love potions into school Fred and George send them di sguised as perfumes and cough potions said Hermione Its part of their Owl Order Service You know a lot about it THE UNBREAKABLE VOW 307 Hermione gave him the kind of na sty look she had just given his copy of Advanced PotionMaking It was all on the back of the bo ttles they showed Ginny and me in the summer she said coldly I dont go around putting potions in peoples drinks or pretending to either which is just as bad Yeah well never mind that said Harry quickly The point is Filch is being fooled isnt he These girls are getting stuff into the school disguised as something else So why couldnt Malfoy have brought the necklace into the school Oh Harry not that again Come on why not demanded Harry Look sighed Hermione Secrecy Sensors detect jinxes curses and concealment charms dont they Theyre used to find Dark Magic and Dark objects Theyd have picked up a powerful curse like the one on that necklace within seconds But something thats just been put in the wrong bottle wouldnt regist er and anyway love potions arent Dark or dangerous Easy for you to say muttered Harry thinking of Romilda Vane so it would be down to Filch to realize it wasnt a cough potion and hes not a very good wiza rd I doubt he can tell one potion from Hermione stopped dead Harry had heard it too Somebody had moved close behind them among the dark bookshelves They waited and a moment later the vu lturelike countenance of Madam Pince appeared around the corner her sunken cheeks her skin like parchment and her long hooked nose illuminated unflatteringly by the lamp she was carrying CHAPTER FIFTEEN 308 T h e l i b r a r y i s n o w c l o s e d she said Mind you return anything you have borrow ed to the correct what have you been doing to that book you depraved boy It isnt the librarys its mine said Harry hastily snatching his copy of Advanced PotionMaking off the table as she lunged at it with a clawlike hand Despoiled she hissed Desecrated Befouled Its just a book thats been wr itten on said Harry tugging it out of her grip She looked as though she might have a seizure Hermione who had hastily packed her things gr abbed Harry by the arm and frogmarched him away Shell ban you from the library if youre not careful Why did you have to bring that stupid book Its not my fault shes barking mad Hermione Or dyou think she overheard you being rude about Filch Ive always thought there might be something going on between them Oh ha ha Enjoying the fact that they co uld speak normally again they made their way along the deserted lamplit corridors back to the common room arguing about whet her or not Filch and Madam Pince were secretly in love with each other Baubles said Harry to the Fat Lady this being the new festive password Same to you said the Fat Lady with a roguish grin and she swung forward to admit them Hi Harry said Romilda Vane the moment he had climbed through the portrait hole Fancy a gillywater THE UNBREAKABLE VOW 309 Hermione gave him a whatdid Itellyou look over her shoulder No thanks said Harry quickl y I dont like it much Well take these anyway said Romilda thrusting a box into his hands Chocolate Cauldrons they ve got firewhisky in them My gran sent them to me but I dont like them Oh right thanks a lot sa id Harry who could not think what else to say Er Im just going over here with He hurried off behind Hermione his voice tailing away feebly Told you said Hermione succinctly Sooner you ask someone sooner theyll all leav e you alone and you can But her face suddenly turned bl ank she had just spotted Ron and Lavender who were entwin ed in the same armchair Well good night Harry said Hermione though it was only seven oclock in the evening and she left for the girls dormitory without another word Harry went to bed comforting himself that there was only one more day of lessons to struggle thro ugh plus Slughorns party after which he and Ron would depart to gether for the Burrow It now seemed impossible that Ron and Hermione would make up with each other before the holidays be gan but perhaps somehow the break would give them time to ca lm down think better of their behavior But his hopes were not high and they sank still lower after enduring a Transfiguration lesson with them both next day They had just embarked upon the immensely difficult topic of human Transfiguration working in front of mi rrors they were supposed to be changing the color of their own eyebrows Hermione laughed CHAPTER FIFTEEN 310 unkindly at Rons disastrous firs t attempt during which he somehow managed to give himself a spectacular handlebar mustache Ron retaliated by doing a cruel but accurate impression of Hermione jumping up and down in her seat every time Professor McGonagall asked a question which Lav ender and Parvati found deeply amusing and which reduced Hermione to the verge of tears again She raced out of the classroom on the bell leaving half her things behind Harry deciding that her need was greater than Rons just now scooped up her remaining possessions and followed her He finally tracked her down as she emerged from a girls bathroom on the floor below She wa s accompanied by Luna Lovegood who was patting her va guely on the back Oh hello Harry said Luna Did you know one of your eyebrows is bright yellow Hi Luna Hermione you l eft your stuff He held out her books Oh yes said Hermione in a chok ed voice taking her things and turning away quickly to hide the fact that she was wiping her eyes on her pencil case Thank you Harry Well Id better get going And she hurried off without giving Harry any time to offer words of comfort though admittedly he could not think of any Shes a bit upset said Luna I thought at first it was Moaning Myrtle in there but it turned ou t to be Hermione She said something about that Ro n Weasley Yeah theyve had a row said Harry He says very funny things sometime s doesnt he said Luna as they set off down the corridor toge ther But he can be a bit unkind I noticed that last year THE UNBREAKABLE VOW 311 I spose said Harry Luna wa s demonstrating her usual knack of speaking uncomfortable truths he had never met anyone quite like her So have you had a good term Oh its been all right said Luna A bit lonely without the DA Ginnys been nice though She stopped two boys in our Transfiguration class calling me Loony the other day How would you like to come to Slughorns party with me tonight The words were out of Harrys mouth before he could stop them he heard himself say them as though it were a stranger speaking Luna turned her protuberant eyes upon him in surprise Slughorns party With you Yeah said Harry Were supp osed to bring guests so I thought you might like I mean He was keen to make his intentions perfectly clear I mean just as friends you know But if you dont want to He was already half hoping that she didnt want to Oh no Id love to go with yo u as friends said Luna beaming as he had never seen her beam before Nob odys ever asked me to a party before as a friend Is that why you dyed your eyebrow for the party Should I do mine too No said Harry firmly that wa s a mistake Ill get Hermione to put it right for me So Ill meet you in the entra nce hall at eight oclock then AHA screamed a voice from overhead and both of them jumped unnoticed by either of th em they had just passed right underneath Peeves who was hanging upside down from a chandelier and grinning maliciously at them CHAPTER FIFTEEN 312 Potty asked Loony to go to the party Potty lurves Loony Potty luuuuurves Looooooony And he zoomed away cackling and shrieking Potty loves Loony Nice to keep these things pr ivate said Harry And sure enough in no time at all the wh ole school seemed to know that Harry Potter was taking Luna Lo vegood to Slughorns party You couldve taken anyone said Ron in disbelief over dinner Anyone And you chose L oony Lovegood Dont call her that Ron snapped Ginny pausing behind Harry on her way to join friends Im really glad youre taking her Harry shes so excited And she moved on down the table to sit with Dean Harry tried to feel pleased that Ginny was glad he was taking Luna to the party but could not quite manage it A long way along the table Hermione was sitting alone playing wi th her stew Harry noticed Ron looking at her furtively You could say sorry su ggested Harry bluntly What and get attacked by another flock of canaries muttered Ron What did you have to imitate her for She laughed at my mustache So did I it was the stupid est thing Ive ever seen But Ron did not seem to have he ard Lavender had just arrived with Parvati Squeezing hersel f in between Harry and Ron Lavender flung her arms around Rons neck Hi Harry said Parvati who li ke him looked faintly embarrassed and bored by the behavi or of their two friends Hi said Harry Howre you Youre staying at Hogwarts then I heard your parent s wanted you to leave THE UNBREAKABLE VOW 313 I managed to talk them out of it for the time being said Parvati That Katie thing really freaked them out but as there hasnt been anything since Oh hi Hermione Parvati positively beamed Harry could tell that she was feeling guilty for having laughed at He rmione in Transfiguration He looked around and saw that Herm ione was beaming back if possible even more brightly Girls were very strange sometimes Hi Parvati said Hermione ignoring Ron and Lavender completely Are you going to Slughorns party tonight No invite said Parvati gloomily Id love to go though it sounds like its going to be really good Youre going arent you Yes Im meeting Cormac at eight and were There was a noise like a plun ger being with drawn from a blocked sink and Ron surfaced He rmione acted as though she had not seen or heard anything were going up to the party together Cormac said Parvati C ormac McLaggen you mean Thats right said Hermione sweetly The one who almost she put a great deal of emphasis on the word became Gryffindor Keeper Are you going out with him th en asked Parvati wideeyed Oh yes didnt you know said Hermione with a most unHermioneish giggle No said Parvati looking positive ly agog at this piece of gossip Wow you like your Quidditch pl ayers dont you First Krum then McLaggen I like really good Quidditch players Hermione corrected her still smiling Well see you Got to go and get ready for the party CHAPTER FIFTEEN 314 She left At once Lavender and Parvati put their heads together to discuss this new development with everything they had ever heard about McLaggen and all th ey had ever guessed about Hermione Ron looked strangely blan k and said nothing Harry was left to ponder in sil ence the depths to which girls would sink to get revenge When he arrived in the entrance hall at eight ocloc k that night he found an unusually large number of girls lurking there all of whom seemed to be staring at hi m resentfully as he approached Luna She was wearing a set of spangled silver robes that were attracting a certain amount of gigg les from the onlookers but otherwise she looked quite nice Harry was glad in any case that she had left off her radish earrings her butterbeer cork necklace and her Spectrespecs Hi he said Shall we get going then Oh yes she said happily Where is the party Slughorns office said Harry leading her up the marble staircase away from all the staring and muttering Did you hear theres supposed to be a vampire coming Rufus Scrimgeour asked Luna I what said Harry discon certed You mean the Minister of Magic Yes hes a vampire said Luna matteroffactly Father wrote a very long article about it when Sc rimgeour first took over from Cornelius Fudge but he was forc ed not to publish by somebody from the Ministry Obviously they didnt want the truth to get out Harry who thought it most unli kely that Rufus Scrimgeour was a vampire but who was used to Lu na repeating her fathers bizarre THE UNBREAKABLE VOW 315 views as though they were fact did not reply they were already approaching Slughorns office and the sounds of laughter music and loud conversation were growin g louder with every step they took Whether it had been built that wa y or because he had used magical trickery to make it so Slughorns office was much larger than the usual teachers study The ce iling and walls had been draped with emerald crimson and gold hangings so that it looked as though they were all inside a va st tent The room was crowded and stuffy and bathed in the red light cast by an ornate golden lamp dangling from the center of the ceiling in which real fairies were fluttering each a brilliant speck of light Loud singing accompanied by what sounded like mandol ins issued from a distant corner a haze of pipe smoke hung over several elderly warlocks deep in conversation and a number of ho useelves were negotiating their way squeakily through the forest of knees obscured by the heavy silver platters of food they were bear ing so that they looked like little roving tables Harry mboy boomed Slughorn almost as soon as Harry and Luna had squeezed in through the door Come in come in so many people Id li ke you to meet Slughorn was wearing a tasseled ve lvet hat to match his smoking jacket Gripping Harrys arm so ti ghtly he might have been hoping to Disapparate with him Slugho rn led him purposefully into the party Harry seized Lunas hand and dragged her along with him Harry Id like you to meet El dred Worple an old student of mine author of Blood Brothers My Life Amongst the Vampires and of course his friend Sanguini Worple who was a small stout bespectacled man grabbed CHAPTER FIFTEEN 316 Harrys hand and shook it enthusia stically the vampire Sanguini who was tall and emaciated with dark shadows under his eyes merely nodded He looked rather bored A gaggle of girls was standing close to him lo oking curious and excited Harry Potter I am simply delighted said Worple peering shortsightedly up into Harrys fa ce I was saying to Professor Slughorn only the other day Where is the biography of Harry Potter for which we have all been waiting Er said Harry were you Just as modest as Horace described said Worple But seriously his manner changed it became suddenly businesslike I would be delighted to write it myself people are craving to know more about you dear boy cr aving If you were prepared to grant me a few interviews say in four or fivehour sessions why we could have the book finished within months And all with very little effort on your part I assure you ask Sanguini here if it isnt quite Sanguini stay here added Worple su ddenly stern for the vampire had been edging toward the nearby group of girls a rather hungry look in his eye H ere have a pasty said Worple seizing one from a passing elf and stuffing it into Sanguinis hand before turning his attention back to Harry My dear boy the gold you coul d make you have no idea Im definitely not interested said Harry firmly and Ive just seen a friend of mine sorry He pulled Luna after him into the crowd he had indeed just seen a long mane of brown hair disappear between what looked like two members of the Weird Sisters Hermione Hermione Harry There you are th ank goodness Hi Luna THE UNBREAKABLE VOW 317 Whats happened to you aske d Harry for Hermione looked distinctly disheveled rather as th ough she had just fought her way out of a thicket of Devils Snare Oh Ive just escaped I mean Ive just left Cormac she said Under the mistletoe she added in explanation as Harry continued to look questioningly at her Serves you right for coming with him he told her severely I thought hed annoy Ron most said Hermione dispassionately I debated for a while abou t Zacharias Smith but I thought on the whole You considered Smith said Harry revolted Yes I did and Im starting to wish Id chosen him McLaggen makes Grawp look a gentleman Lets go this way well be able to see him coming hes so tall The three of them made their way over to the othe r side of the room scooping up goblets of mead on the way realizing too late that Professor Trelawney wa s standing there alone Hello said Luna politely to Professor Trelawney Good evening my dear said Professor Trelawney focusing upon Luna with some difficulty Harry could smell cooking sherry again I havent seen you in my classes lately No Ive got Firenze th is year said Luna Oh of course said Profe ssor Trelawney with an angry drunken titter Or Dobbin as I pr efer to think of him You would have thought would you not that now I am returned to the school Professor Dumbledore might have got rid of the horse But no we share classes Its an insult frankly an insult Do you know Professor Trelawney seemed too tipsy to have recognized Harry CHAPTER FIFTEEN 318 Under cover of her furious criticisms of Firenze Harry drew closer to Hermione and said Lets get something straight Are you planning to tell Ron that you in terfered at Keeper tryouts Hermione raised her eyebrows Do you really think Id stoop that low Harry looked at her shrewdly H ermione if you can ask out McLaggen Theres a difference said Hermio ne with dignity Ive got no plans to tell Ron anything about wh at might or might not have happened at Keeper tryouts Good said Harry fervently Because hell just fall apart again and well lose the next match Quidditch said Hermione angrily Is that all boys care about Cormac hasnt asked me one single question about myself no Ive just been treated to A Hundre d Great Saves Made by Cormac McLaggen nonstop ever since oh no here he comes She moved so fast it was as th ough she had Disapparated one moment she was there the next she had squeezed between two guffawing witches and vanished Seen Hermione asked McLagg en forcing his way through the throng a minute later No sorry said Harry and he tu rned quickly to join in Lunas conversation forgetting for a split second to whom she was talking Harry Potter said Professor Trelawney in deep vibrant tones noticing him for the first time Oh hello said Harry unenthusiastically My dear boy she said in a ve ry carrying whisper The rumors The stories The Chosen One Of course I have known for a very long time The omens were never good Harry But why THE UNBREAKABLE VOW 319 have you not returned to Divination For you of all people the subject is of the utmost importance Ah Sybill we all think our su bjects most important said a loud voice and Slughorn appeared at Professor Trelawneys other side his face very red his velvet hat a little askew a glass of mead in one hand and an enormous mince pie in the other But I dont think Ive ever known such a natural at Potions said Slughorn regarding Harry with a fond if bl oodshot eye Instinctive you know like his mother Ive only ever taught a few with this kind of ability I can tell you that Sybill why even Severus And to Harrys horror Slughorn threw out an arm and seemed to scoop Snape out of thin air toward them Stop skulking and come and join us Severus hiccuped Slughorn happily I was just ta lking about Harrys exceptional potionmaking Some credit must go to you of course you taught him for five years Trapped with Slughorns arm around his shoulders Snape looked down his hooked nose at Harry his black eyes narrowed Funny I never had the impressi on that I managed to teach Potter anything at all Well then its natural ability shouted Slughorn You should have seen what he gave me first lesson Draught of Living Death never had a student produce finer on a first attempt I dont think even you Severus Really said Snape quietly his ey es still boring into Harry who felt a certain disquiet The last th ing he wanted was for Snape to start investigating the source of hi s newfound brilliance at Potions Remind me what other subjects youre taking Harry asked Slughorn CHAPTER FIFTEEN 320 Defense Against the Dark Arts Charms Transfiguration Herbology All the subjects required in shor t for an Auror said Snape with the faintest sneer Yeah well thats what Id like to do said Harry defiantly And a great one youll make too boomed Slughorn I dont think you should be an Auror Harry said Luna unexpectedly Everybody looked at her The Aurors are part of the Rotfang Conspiracy I thought ev eryone knew that Theyre working to bring down the Ministry of Magic from within using a combination of Dark Ma gic and gum disease Harry inhaled half his mead up his nose as he started to laugh Really it had been worth bringing Luna just for this Emerging from his goblet coughing sopping wet but still grinning he saw something calculated to raise his spirits even higher Draco Malfoy being dragged by th e ear toward them by Argus Filch Professor Slughorn wheezed Fi lch his jowls aquiver and the maniacal light of mischiefdetectio n in his bulging eyes I discovered this boy lurking in an upstai rs corridor He claims to have been invited to your pa rty and to have been delayed in setting out Did you issue him with an invitation Malfoy pulled himself free of Filchs grip looking furious All right I wasnt invited he said angrily I was trying to gatecrash happy No Im not said Filch a stat ement at complete odds with the glee on his face Youre in trouble you are Didnt the headmaster say that nighttime prowlings out unless youve got permission didnt he eh Thats all right Argus thats al l right said Slughorn waving a THE UNBREAKABLE VOW 321 hand Its Christmas and its no t a crime to want to come to a party Just this once well forg et any punishment you may stay Draco Filchs expression of outraged disappointment was perfectly predictable but why Harry wonder ed watching him did Malfoy look almost equally unhappy An d why was Snape looking at Malfoy as though both angry and wa s it possible a little afraid But almost before Harry had regi stered what he had seen Filch had turned and shuffled away mu ttering under his breath Malfoy had composed his face into a smile and was thanking Slughorn for his generosity and Snap es face was smoothly inscrutable again Its nothing nothing said Sl ughorn waving away Malfoys thanks I did know your gran dfather after all He always spoke very highly of you sir said Malfoy quickly Said you were the best potionmaker hed ever known Harry stared at Malfoy It was no t the suckingup that intrigued him he had watched Malf oy do that to Snape for a long time It was the fact that Malfoy did after all look a little ill This was the first time he had seen Malfoy cl ose up for ages he now saw that Malfoy had dark shadows under his eyes and a distinctly grayish tinge to his skin Id like a word with you Draco said Snape suddenly Oh now Severus said Slughorn hiccuping again its Christmas dont be too hard Im his Head of House and I shall decide how hard or otherwise to be said Snape curtly Follow me Draco They left Snape leading the wa y Malfoy looking resentful Harry stood there for a moment irreso lute then said Ill be back in a bit Luna er bathroom CHAPTER FIFTEEN 322 All right she said cheerfully and he thought he heard her as he hurried off into the crowd resume the subject of the Rotfang Conspiracy with Professor Trelaw ney who seemed sincerely interested It was easy once out of the party to pull his Invisibility Cloak out of his pocket and throw it ov er himself for the corridor was quite deserted What was more difficult was finding Snape and Malfoy Harry ran down the corridor the noise of his feet masked by the music and loud talk still is suing from Slughorns office behind him Perhaps Snape had taken Malfoy to his office in the dungeons or perhaps he was esco rting him back to the Slytherin common room Harry pressed his ear against door after door as he dashed down the corridor until with a great jolt of excitement he crouched down to the keyhole of the last classroom in the corridor and heard voices cannot afford mistakes Draco because if you are expelled I didnt have anything to do with it all right I hope you are telling the truth because it was both clumsy and foolish Already you are suspecte d of having a hand in it W h o s u s p e c t s m e s a i d M a l f o y a n g r i l y F o r t h e l a s t t i m e I didnt do it okay That Bell gi rl mustve had an enemy no one knows about dont look at me li ke that I know what youre doing Im not stupid but it wo nt work I can stop you There was a pause and then Snape said quietly Ah Aunt Bellatrix has been teac hing you Occlumency I see What thoughts are you trying to conceal from your master Draco Im not trying to conceal anything from him I just dont want you butting in THE UNBREAKABLE VOW 323 Harry pressed his ear still more cl osely against the keyhole What had happened to make Malfoy speak to Snape like this Snape toward whom he had always shown respect even liking So that is why you have been avoiding me this term You have feared my interference You realize that had anybody else failed to come to my office when I had told them repeatedly to be there Draco So put me in detention Report me to Dumbledore jeered Malfoy There was another pause Then Snape said You know perfectly well that I do not wish to do either of th ose things Youd better stop telling me to come to your office then Listen to me said Snape his voice so low now that Harry had to push his ear very hard against the keyhole to hear I am trying to help you I swore to your mother I would protect you I made the Unbreakable Vow Draco Looks like youll have to brea k it then because I dont need your protection Its my job he ga ve it to me and Im doing it Ive got a plan and its going to work it s just taking a bit longer than I thought it would What is your plan Its none of your business If you tell me what you are tryi ng to do I can assist you Ive got all the assistance I need thanks Im not alone You were certainly alone tonigh t which was foolish in the extreme wandering the corridors without lookouts or backup these are elementary mistakes I wouldve had Crabbe and Goyl e with me if you hadnt put them in detention CHAPTER FIFTEEN 324 Keep your voice down spat Sn ape for Malfoys voice had risen excitedly If your friends Crabbe and Goyle intend to pass their Defense Against the Dark Arts OWL this time around they will need to work a little harder than they are do ing at pres What does it matter said Ma lfoy Defense Against the Dark Arts its all just a joke isnt it an act Like any of us need protecting against the Dark Arts It is an act that is crucial to success Draco said Snape Where do you think I would have been all these years if I had not known how to act Now listen to me Yo u are being incautious wandering around at night getting yourself caught and if you are placing your reliance in assistants like Crabbe and Goyle Theyre not the only ones Ive got other people on my side better people Then why not confide in me and I can I know what youre up to You want to steal my glory There was another pause then Snape said coldly You are speaking like a child I quite unde rstand that your fathers capture and imprisonment has upset you but Harry had barely a seconds warnin g he heard Malfoys footsteps on the other side of the door and flung himself out of the way just as it burst open Malfoy was stri ding away down the corridor past the open door of Slughorns office around the distant corner and out of sight Hardly daring to breathe Ha rry remained crouched down as Snape emerged slowly from the cl assroom His expression unfathomable he returned to the party Harry remained on the floor hidden beneath the cloak his mind racing S I X T E E N 325 A VER Y FROSTY CHRISTMAS o Snape was offering to help him He was definitely offering to help him If you ask that once more said Harry Im going to stick this sprout Im only checking said Ron They were standi ng alone at the Burrows kitchen sink peeling a mountain of sprouts for Mrs Weasley Snow was drifting past the window in front of them Yes Snape was offering to help him said Harry He said hed promised Malfoys mother to prot ect him that hed made an Unbreakable Oath or something An Unbreakable Vow said Ron looking stunned Nah he cant have Are you sure Yes Im sure said Harry Why what does it mean Well you cant break an Unbreakable Vow I d w o r k e d t h a t m u c h o u t f o r myself funnily enough What happens if you break it then S CHAPTER SIXTEEN 326 You die said Ron simply Fred and George tried to get me to make one when I was about five I nearly did too I was holding hands with Fred and everythin g when Dad found us He went mental said Ron with a remi niscent gleam in his eyes Only time Ive ever seen Dad as angry as Mum Fred reckons his left buttock has never been the same since Yeah well passing over Freds left buttock I beg your pardon said Freds voice as the twins entered the kitchen Aaah George look at this Theyre using knives and everything Bless them Ill be seventeen in two and a bit months time said Ron grumpily and then Ill be able to do it by magic But meanwhile said George si tting down at the kitchen table and putting his feet up on it we can enjoy watching you demonstrate the correct use of a whoopsadaisy You made me do that said Ron angrily sucking his cut thumb You wait when Im seventeen Im sure youll dazzle us all with hitherto unsuspected magical skills yawned Fred And speaking of hitherto unsuspected skills Ronald said George what is this we hear from Ginny about you and a young lady called unless our informatio n is faulty Lavender Brown Ron turned a little pink but did not look displeased as he turned back to the sprouts Mind your own business What a snappy retort said Fred I really dont know how you think of them No what we wanted to know was how did it happen A VERY FROSTY CHRISTMAS 327 What dyou mean Did she have an accident or something What Well how did she sustain such extensive brain damage Careful now Mrs Weasley entered the room just in time to see Ron throw the sprout knife at Fred who had turned it into a paper airplane with one lazy flick of his wand Ron she said furiously Dont you ever let me see you throwing knives again I wont said Ron let you s ee he added under his breath as he turned back to the sprout mountain Fred George Im sorry dears bu t Remus is arriving tonight so Bill will have to squeeze in with you two No problem said George Then as Charlie isnt coming home that just leaves Harry and Ron in the attic and if Fl eur shares with Ginny thatll make Ginnys Ch ristmas muttered Fred everyone should be comfortabl e Well theyll have a bed anyway said Mrs Weasley sounding slightly harassed Percy definitely not showing hi s ugly face then asked Fred Mrs Weasley turned away before she answered No hes busy I expect at the Ministry Or hes the worlds biggest prat said Fred as Mrs Weasley left the kitchen One of the two Well lets get going then George What are you two up to asked Ron Cant you help us with these sprouts You could just use your wand and then well be free too CHAPTER SIXTEEN 328 No I dont think we can do that said Fred seriously Its very characterbuilding stuff learning to peel sprouts without magic makes you appreciate how difficult it is for Muggles and Squibs and if you want people to help you Ron added George t h r o w i n g t h e p a p e r a i r p l a n e a t h i m I w o u l d n t c h u c k k n i v e s a t them Just a little hint Were off to the village theres a very pretty girl working in the paper shop who thinks my card tricks are something marvelous almost like real magic Gits said Ron darkly watching Fred and George setting off across the snowy yard Wouldve on ly taken them ten seconds and then we could ve gone too I c o u l d n t s a i d H a r r y I promised Dumbledore I wouldnt wander off while Im staying here Oh yeah said Ron He peeled a few more sp routs and then said Are you going to tell Dumbledore what you heard Snape and Malfoy saying to each other Yep said Harry Im going to tell anyone who can put a stop to it and Dumbledores top of the list I might have another word with your dad too Pity you didnt hear what Malf oys actually doing though I couldnt have done could I That was the whole point he was refusing to tell Snape There was silence for a moment or two then Ron said Course you know what theyll all say Dad and Dumbledore and all of them Theyll say Snape isnt really trying to help Malfoy he was just trying to find out what Malfoys up to They didnt hear him said Harry flatly No ones that good an actor not even Snape Yeah Im just sayi ng though said Ron A VERY FROSTY CHRISTMAS 329 Harry turned to face him frow ning You think Im right though Yeah I do said Ron hastily Seriously I do But theyre all convinced Snapes in the Order arent they Harry said nothing It had alre ady occurred to him that this would be the most likely objection to his new evidence he could hear Hermione now Obviously Harry he wa s pretending to offer help so he could trick Malfoy in to telling him what hes doing This was pure imagination howe ver as he had had no opportunity to tell Hermione what he had overheard She had disappeared from Slughorns parry before he re turned to it or so he had been informed by an irate McLaggen and she had already gone to bed by the time he returned to the common room As he and Ron had left for the Burrow earl y the next day he had barely had time to wish her a happy Christ mas and to tell her th at he had some very important news when they got back from the holidays He was not entirely sure that she had hear d him though Ron and Lavender had been saying a thoroughly no nverbal goodbye just behind him at the time Still even Hermione would not be able to deny one thing Malfoy was definitely up to somethin g and Snape knew it so Harry felt fully justified in saying I to ld you so which he had done several times to Ron already Harry did not get the chance to speak to Mr Weasley who was working very long hours at the Ministry until Christmas Eve night The Weasleys and their gues ts were sitting in the living room which Ginny had decorated so lavishly that it was rather like sitting in a paperchain explosion Fred George Harry and Ron were the only ones who knew that the angel on top of the tree was CHAPTER SIXTEEN 330 actually a garden gnome that had bitten Fred on the ankle as he pulled up carrots for Christmas dinner Stupefied painted gold stuffed into a miniature tutu an d with small wing s glued to its back it glowered down at them all the ugliest angel Harry had ever seen with a large bald head like a potato and rather hairy feet They were all supposed to be listening to a Christmas broadcast by Mrs Weasleys favorite singer Celestina Warbeck whose voice was warbling out of the large wooden wireless set Fleur who seemed to find Celestina very dull was talkin g so loudly in the corner that a scowling Mrs Weasley kept pointing her wand at the volume control so that Celestina grew louder and louder Under cover of a particularly jazzy number called A Cauldron Full of Hot Strong Love Fred and George started a game of Exploding Snap with Ginny Ron kept shooting Bill and Fleur covert looks as though hoping to pick up tips Meanwhil e Remus Lupin who was thinner and more raggedlooking than ever was sitting beside the fire staring into its depths as though he could not hear Celestinas voice Oh come and stir my cauldron And if you do it right Ill boil you up some hot strong love To keep you warm tonight We danced to this when we were eighteen said Mrs Weasley wiping her eyes on her knitti ng Do you remember Arthur Mphf said Mr Weasley whos e head had been nodding over the satsuma he was peeling Oh yes marvelous tune With an effort he sat up a little straighter and looked around at Harry who was sitting next to him A VERY FROSTY CHRISTMAS 331 Sorry about this he said jerkin g his head toward the wireless as Celestina broke into th e chorus Be over soon No problem said Harry grinning Has it been busy at the Ministry Very said Mr Weasley I wouldnt mind if we were getting anywhere but of the three arrests we ve made in the last couple of months I doubt that one of them is a genuine Death Eater only dont repeat that Harry he a dded quickly looking much more awake all of a sudden Theyre not still holding Stan Shunpike are they asked Harry Im afraid so said Mr Weasley I know Dumbledores tried appealing directly to Scrimgeour about Stan I mean anybody who has actually interviewed him agrees that hes about as much a Death Eater as this satsuma bu t the top levels want to look as though theyre making some progre ss and three arrests sounds better than three mistaken arrests and releases but again this is all top secret I wont say anything said Harr y He hesitated for a moment wondering how best to embark on w h a t h e w a n t e d t o s a y a s h e marshaled his thoughts Celestina Warbeck began a ballad called You Charmed the Heart Right Out of Me Mr Weasley you know what I told you at the station when we were setting off for school I checked Harry said Mr Weasley at once I went and searched the Malfoys house Ther e was nothing either broken or whole that shouldnt have been there Yeah I know I saw in the Prophet that youd looked but this is something different Well something more And he told Mr Weasley everything he had overheard between CHAPTER SIXTEEN 332 Malfoy and Snape As Harry spoke he saw Lupins head turn a little toward him taking in every word When he had finished there was silence except for Celestinas crooning Oh my poor heart where has it gone Its left me for a spell Has it occurred to you Harry said Mr Weasley that Snape was simply pretending Pretending to offer help so th at he could find out what Malfoys up to said Harry quickly Yeah I thought youd say that But how do we know It isnt our business to know said Lupin unexpectedly He had turned his back on the fire now and faced Harry across Mr Weasley Its Dumbledores business Dumbledore trusts Severus and that ought to be good enough for all of us But said Harry just say just say Dumbledores wrong about Snape People have said it many times It comes down to whether or not you trust Dumbledores judgment I do therefore I trust Severus But Dumbledore can make mistak es argued Harry He says it himself And you he looked Lupin straight in the eye do you honestly like Snape I neither like nor dislike Severus said Lupin No Harry I am speaking the truth he added as Harry pulled a skeptical expression We shall never be bosom fri ends perhaps after all that happened between James and Sirius an d Severus there is too much bitterness there But I do not forget that during the year I taught at A VERY FROSTY CHRISTMAS 333 Hogwarts Severus made the Wolfsbane Potion for me every month made it perfectly so that I did not have to suffer as I usually do at the full moon But he accidentally let it slip that youre a werewolf so you had to leave said Harry angrily Lupin shrugged The news would have leaked out anyway We b o t h k n o w h e w a n t e d m y j o b b u t h e c o u l d h a v e w r e a k e d m u c h worse damage on me by tamperin g with the potion He kept me healthy I must be grateful Maybe he didnt da re mess with the potion with Dumbledore watching him said Harry You are determined to hate hi m Harry said Lupin with a faint smile And I understand with James as your father with Sirius as your godfather you have in herited an old prejudice By all means tell Dumbledore what you ha ve told Arthur and me but do not expect him to share your view of the matter do not even expect him to b e s urprised b y wha t you tel l h im It mig ht ha v e bee n on Dumbledores orders that Se verus questioned Draco and now youve torn it quite apart Ill thank you to give back my heart Celestina ended her song on a very long highpitched note and loud applause issued out of the wireless which Mrs Weasley joined in with enthusiastically Eez eet over said Fleur loudly Thank goodness what an orrible Shall we have a nightcap then asked Mr Weasley loudly leaping to his feet Who wants eggnog CHAPTER SIXTEEN 334 What have you been up to lately Harry asked Lupin as Mr Weasley bustled off to fetch th e eggnog and everybody else stretched and broke into conversation Oh Ive been underground said Lupin Almost literally Thats why I havent been able to write Harry sending letters to you would have been something of a giveaway What do you mean Ive been living among my fellows my equals said Lupin Werewolves he added at Har rys look of incomprehension Nearly all of them are on Vold emorts side Dumbledore wanted a spy and here I was readymade He sounded a little bitter and perhaps realized it for he smiled more warmly as he went on I am not complaining it is necessary work and who can do it better than I Howeve r it has been difficult gaining their trust I bear the unmistakable signs of having tried to live among wizards you see whereas they have shunned normal society and live on the ma rgins stealing and sometimes killing to eat How come they like Voldemort They think that under his rule they will ha ve a better life said Lupin And it is hard to ar gue with Greyback out there Whos Greyback You havent heard of him Lupin s hands closed convulsively in his lap Fenrir Greyba ck is perhaps the most savage werewolf alive today He regards it as his mi ssion in life to bite and to contaminate as many people as possible he wants to create enough werewolves to overcome the wizards Voldemort has promised him prey in return for his services Greyback specializes in children Bite them young he says and raise them away from their parents raise A VERY FROSTY CHRISTMAS 335 them to hate normal wizards Vo ldemort has threatened to unleash him upon peoples sons and daughters it is a threat that usually produces good results Lupin paused and then said I t was Greyback who bit me What said Harry astonish ed When when you were a kid you mean Yes My father had offended him I did not know for a very long time the id entity of the werewolf who had atta cked me I even felt pity for him thinking that he had had no control knowing by then how it felt to transfor m But Greyback is not like that At the full moon he positions hi mself close to victims ensuring that he is near enough to strike He plans it all And this is the man Voldemort is using to marshal the werewolves I cannot pretend that my particular brand of reas oned argument is making much headway against Greybacks insisten ce that we werewolves deserve blood that we ought to revenge ourselves on normal people But you are normal said Harry fiercely Youve just got a a problem Lupin burst out laughing Somet imes you remind me a lot of James He called it my furry li ttle problem in company Many people were under the impression that I owned a badly behaved rabbit He accepted a glass of eggnog fr om Mr Weasley with a word of thanks looking slightly more ch eerful Harry meanwhile felt a rush of excitement This last me ntion of his father had reminded him that there was so mething he had been l ooking forward to asking Lupin Have you ever heard of someone called the HalfBlood Prince The HalfBlood what CHAPTER SIXTEEN 336 Prince said Harry watching him closely for signs of recognition There are no Wizarding princes said Lupin now smiling Is this a title youre thinking of ad opting I should have thought being the Chosen One would be enough Its nothing to do with me sa id Harry indignantly The HalfBlood Prince is someone who used to go to Hogwarts Ive got his old Potions book He wrote spells all over it spells he invented One of them was Levicorpus Oh that one had a great vogue during my time at Hogwarts said Lupin reminiscently There were a few months in my fifth year when you couldnt move for be ing hoisted into the air by your ankle My dad used it said Harry I saw him in the Pensieve he used it on Snape He tried to sound casual as though this was a throwaway comment of no real importance but he was not sure he had achieved the right effect Lupins smile was a little too understanding Yes he said but he wasnt the only one As I say it was very popular You know how thes e spells come and go B u t i t s o u n d s l i k e i t w a s i n v e n t e d w h i l e y o u w e r e a t s c h o o l Harry persisted Not necessarily said Lupin J inxes go in and out of fashion like everything else He looked into Harrys face and then said quietly James was a pureblood Harry and I promise you he never asked us to call him Prince Abandoning pretense Harry said And it wasnt Sirius Or you A VERY FROSTY CHRISTMAS 337 Definitely not Oh Harry stared into the fire I just thought well hes helped me out a lot in Potion s classes the Prince has How old is this book Harry I dunno Ive never checked W e l l p e r h a p s t h a t w i l l g i v e y o u s o m e c l u e a s t o w h e n t h e Prince was at Hogwar ts said Lupin Shortly after this Fleur decided to imitate Celestina singing A Cauldron Full of Hot Strong Love which was taken by everyone once they had glimpsed Mrs Weasleys expression to be the cue to go to bed Harry and Ron climbed all the way up to Rons attic bedroom where a camp bed had been adde d for Harry Ron fell asleep almost immediatel y but Harry delved into his trunk and pulled out his copy of Advanced PotionMaking before getting into bed There he turned its pages searching until he finally found at the front of the book the date that it had been published It was nearly fifty years old Neither his father nor his fathers friends had been at Hogwarts fift y years ago Feeling disappointed Harry threw the book back into his trunk turned off the lamp and rolled over thinking of werewolves and Snape Stan Shunpike and the HalfBlood Prince and finally falling into an uneasy sleep full of creeping shadows and the crie s of bitten children Shes got to be joking Harry woke with a start to find a bulging stocking lying over the end of his bed He put on his glasses and looked around the tiny window was almost completely obscured with snow and in front of it Ron was sitting bolt uprigh t in bed and examining what appeared to be a thick gold chain CHAPTER SIXTEEN 338 Whats that asked Harry Its from Lavender said Ron sounding revolted She cant honestly think Id wear Harry looked more closely and le t out a shout of laughter Dangling from the chain in large gold letters were the words My Sweetheart Nice he said Classy You should definitely wear it in front of Fred and George If you tell them said Ron sh oving the necklace out of sight under his pillow I I Ill Stutter at me said Harry grinning Come on would I How could she think Id like something like that though Ron demanded of thin air looking rather shocked Well think back sa id Harry Have you ever let it slip that youd like to go out in public with the words My Sweetheart round your neck Well we dont really talk much said Ron Its mainly Snogging said Harry W e l l y e a h s a i d R o n H e h e sitated a moment then said Is Hermione really going out with McLaggen I dunno said Harry They were at Slughorns party together but I dont think it went that well Ron looked slightly more cheerful as he delved deeper into his stocking Harrys presents included a sweate r with a large Golden Snitch worked onto the front handknitt ed by Mrs Weasley a large box of Weasleys Wizard Wheezes products from the twins and a A VERY FROSTY CHRISTMAS 339 slightly damp moldysmelling pack age that came with a label reading To Master From Kreacher Harry stared at it Dy ou reckon this is safe to open he asked Cant be anything dangerous all our mails still being searched at the Ministry replied Ron th ough he was eyeing the parcel suspiciously I didnt think of giving Kreach er anything Do people usually give their houseelves Christmas presents asked Harry prodding the parcel cautiously Hermione would said Ron But lets wait and see what it is before you start feeling guilty A moment later Harry had given a loud yell and leapt out of his camp bed the package containe d a large number of maggots Nice said Ron roaring with laughter Very thoughtful Id rather have them than th at necklace said Harry which sobered Ron up at once Everybody was wearing new sweaters when they all sat down for Christmas lunch everyone except Fleur on whom it appeared Mrs Weasley had not wanted to waste one and Mrs Weasley herself who was sporting a bran dnew midnight blue witchs hat glittering with what looked like tiny starlike diamonds and a spectacular golden necklace Fred and George gave them to me Arent they beautiful Well we find we appreciate you more and more Mum now were washing our own socks said George waving an airy hand Parsnips Remus Harry youve got a maggot in your hair said Ginny cheerfully leaning across the table to pick it out Harry felt goose bumps erupt up his neck that had nothin g to do with the maggot CHAPTER SIXTEEN 340 Ow orrible said Fleur wi th an affected little shudder Yes isnt it said Ron Gravy Fleur In his eagerness to help her he knocked the gravy boat flying Bill waved his wand and the gravy so ared up in the air and returned meekly to the boat You are as bad as zat Tonks said Fleur to Ron when she had finished kissing Bill in thanks She is always knocking I invited dear Tonks to come along toda y said Mrs Weasley setting down the carrots with unnecessary force and glaring at Fleur But she wouldnt come Have yo u spoken to her lately Remus No I havent been in contact with anybody very much said Lupin But Tonks has got her own family to go to hasnt she Hmmm said Mrs Weasley M aybe I got the impression she was planning to spend Christmas alone actually She gave Lupin an annoyed look as though it was all his fault she was getting Fleur for a daught erinlaw instead of Tonks but Harry glancing across at Fleur who was now feeding Bill bits of turkey off her own fork thought that Mrs Weasley was fighting a longlost battle He was however reminded of a question he had with regard to Tonks and who be tter to ask than Lupin the man who knew all about Patronuses Tonkss Patronus has changed it s form he told him Snape said so anyway I didnt know th at could happen Why would your Patronus change Lupin took his time chewing his turkey and swallowing before saying slowly Sometimes a great shock an emotional upheaval It looked big and it had four le gs said Harry struck by a sudden thought and lowering his voice Hey it couldnt be A VERY FROSTY CHRISTMAS 341 Arthur said Mrs Weasley su ddenly She had risen from her chair her hand was pr essed over her heart an d she was staring out of the kitchen window Arthur its Percy What Mr Weasley looked around Ever ybody looked quickly at the window Ginny stood up for a better look There sure enough was Percy Weasley striding across the snowy yard his hornrimmed glasses glinting in the sunlight He was not ho wever alone Arthur hes hes with the Mi nister And sure enough the ma n Harry had seen in the Daily Prophet was following along in Percys wa ke limping slightly his mane of graying hair and his black cloak fl ecked with snow Before any of them could say anything before Mr and Mrs Weasley could do more than exchange stunned lo oks the back door opened and there stood Percy There was a moments painful silence Then Percy said rather stiffly Merry Christmas Mother Oh Percy said Mrs Weasley and she threw herself into his arms Rufus Scrimgeour paused in th e doorway leaning on his walking stick and smiling as he observed this affecting scene You must forgive this intrusio n he said when Mrs Weasley looked around at him beaming an d wiping her eyes Percy and I were in the vicinity working you know and he couldnt resist dropping in an d seeing you all But Percy showed no sign of want ing to greet any of the rest of the family He stood pokerstra ight and awkwardlooking and stared over everybody elses head s Mr Weasley Fred and George were all observing him stonyfaced CHAPTER SIXTEEN 342 Please come in sit down Minister fluttered Mrs Weasley straightening her hat H ave a little purkey or some tooding I mean No no my dear Molly said Scrimgeour Harry guessed that he had checked her name with Perc y before they entered the house I dont want to intrude wouldnt be here at all if Percy hadnt wanted to see you al l so badly Oh Perce said Mrs Weasley tearfully reaching up to kiss him Weve only looked in for five minutes so Ill have a stroll around the yard while you catch up with Percy No no I assure you I dont want to butt in Well if anybody cared to show me your charming garden Ah that young mans finished why doesnt he take a stroll with me The atmosphere around the tabl e changed perceptibly Everybody looked from Scrimgeour to Harry Nobody seemed to find Scrimgeour s pretense that he di d not know Harrys name convincing or find it natural that he should be chosen to accompany the Minister around the garden when Ginny Fleur and George also had clean plates Yeah all right said Harry into the silence He was not fooled for all Scrimge ours talk that they had just been in the area that Percy wanted to look up his family this must be the real reason that they ha d come so that Scrimgeour could speak to Harry alone Its fine he said quietly as he passed Lupin who had half risen from his chair Fine he added as Mr Weasley opened his mouth to speak Wonderful said Scrimgeour st anding back to let Harry pass A VERY FROSTY CHRISTMAS 343 through the door ahead of him We ll just take a turn around the garden and Percy and Ill be off Carry on everyone Harry walked across the yard towa rd the Weasleys overgrown snowcovered garden Scrimgeour li mping slightly at his side He had Harry knew been Head of th e Auror office he looked tough and battlescarred very different fr om portly Fudge in his bowler hat Charming said Scrimgeour st opping at the garden fence and looking out over the snowy lawn and the indistinguishable plants Charming Harry said nothing He could te ll that Scrimgeo ur was watching him Ive wanted to meet you for a ve ry long time said Scrimgeour after a few moments Did you know that No said Harry truthfully Oh yes for a very long time But Dumbledore has been very protective of you said Scrimgeo ur Natural of course natural after what youve been through Especially what happened at the Ministry He waited for Harry to say some thing but Harry did not oblige so he went on I have been hoping for an occasion to talk to you ever since I gained office bu t Dumbledore has most understandably as I say prevented this Still Harry said nothing waiting The rumors that have flown ar ound said Scrimgeour Well of course we both know how these stories get distorted all these whispers of a prophecy of you being the Chosen One They were getting near it now Harry though t the reason Scrimgeour was here CHAPTER SIXTEEN 344 I assume that Dumbledore has discussed these matters with you Harry deliberated wondering whether he ought to lie or not He looked at the little gnome prin ts all around the flowerbeds and the scuffedup patch that marked the spot where Fred had caught the gnome now wearing the tutu at the top of the Christmas tree Finally he decided on the truth or a bit of it Yeah weve discussed it Have you have you said Scrimgeour Harry could see out o f t h e c o r n e r o f h i s e y e S c r i m g e o u r s q u i n t i n g a t h i m s o h e p r e tended to be very interested in a gnome that had just poked its head out from underneath a frozen rhododendron And what has Dumbledore told you Harry Sorry but thats between us sa id Harry He kept his voice as p l e a s a n t a s h e c o u l d a n d S c r i m g eours tone too was light and friendly as he said Oh of course if its a question of confidences I wouldnt want you to divulge no no and in any case does it really matter whether you ar e the Chosen One or not Harry had to mull that one over for a few seconds before responding I dont really know what you mean Minister Well of course to you it will matter enormously said Scrimgeour with a laugh But to the Wizarding community at large its all perception isnt it Its wh at people believe thats important Harry said nothing He thought he saw dimly where they were heading but he was not going to help Scrimgeour get there The gnome under the rhododendron was now digging for worms at its roots and Harry kept hi s eyes fixed upon it People believe you are the Chosen One you see said Scrimgeour They think you quite the hero which of course you A VERY FROSTY CHRISTMAS 345 are Harry chosen or not How many times have you faced HeWhoMustNotBeNamed now We ll anyway he pressed on without waiting for a reply the po int is you are a symbol of hope for many Harry The idea that there is somebody out there who might be able who might even be destined to destroy HeWhoMustNotBeNamed we ll naturally it give s people a lift And I cant help but feel that once you realize this you might consider it well almost a duty to stand alongside the Ministry and give everyone a boost The gnome had just managed to ge t hold of a worm It was now tugging very hard on it trying to get it out of the frozen ground Harry was silent so long that Sc rimgeour said looking from Harry to the gnome Funny little chap s arent they But what say you Harry I dont exactly understand what you want said Harry slowly Stand alongside the Ministry What does that mean Oh well nothing at all onerou s I assure you said Scrimgeour If you were to be seen popping in and out of the Ministry from time to time for instance that would give the right impression And of course while you we re there you would have ample opportunity to speak to Gawain Ro bards my successor as Head of the Auror office Dolores Umbridge has told me that you cherish an ambition to become an Auror Well that could be arranged very easily Harry felt anger bubbling in the pi t of his stomach So Dolores Umbridge was still at the Ministry was she So basically he said as though he just wanted to clarify a few points youd like to give the impression that Im working for the Ministry CHAPTER SIXTEEN 346 It would give everyone a lift to think you were more involved Harry said Scrimgeour sounding relieved that Harry had cottoned on so quickly The Chos en One you know Its all about giving people hope the feeli ng that exciting things are happening But if I keep running in and out of the Ministry said Harry still endeavoring to keep his voic e friendly wont that seem as though I approve of what the Ministrys up to Well said Scrimgeour frowning slightly well yes thats partly why wed like No I dont think thatll work said Harry pleasantly You see I dont like some of the things the Ministrys doing Locking up Stan Shunpike for instance Scrimgeour did not speak for a mo ment but his expression hardened instantly I wo uld not expect you to understand he said and he was not as successful at keeping anger out of his voice as Harry had been These are danger ous times and certain measures need to be taken You are sixteen years old Dumbledores a lot older than sixteen and he doesnt think Stan should be in Azkaban either said Harry Youre making Stan a scapegoat just like you wa nt to make me a mascot They looked at each other lo ng and hard Finally Scrimgeour said with no pretense at warmth I see You prefer like your hero Dumbledore to disassociate yourself from the Ministry I dont want to be used said Harry Some would say its your duty to be used by the Ministry Yeah and others might say its your duty to check that people really are Death Eaters before yo u chuck them in prison said Harry his temper rising now Youre doing what Barty Crouch A VERY FROSTY CHRISTMAS 347 did You never get it right you people do you Either weve got Fudge pretending everythings lo vely while people get murdered right under his nose or weve got you chucking the wrong people into jail and trying to pretend youve got the Chosen One working for you So youre not the Chosen One said Scrimgeour I thought you said it didnt matte r either way sa id Harry with a bitter laugh Not to you anyway I shouldnt have said that said Scrimgeour quickly It was tactless No it was honest said Harry One of the only honest things youve said to me You dont care whether I live or die but you do care that I help you convince everyone youre winning the war against Voldemort I havent forgotten Minister He raised his right fist There shining white on the back of his cold hand were the scars which Dolores Umbridge had forced him to carve into his own flesh I must not tell lies I dont remember you rushing to my defense when I was trying to tell everyone Voldemort was ba ck The Ministry wasnt so keen to be pals last year They stood in silence as icy as th e ground beneath their feet The gnome had finally managed to ex tricate his worm and was now sucking on it happily leaning agai nst the bottommost branches of the rhododendron bush What is Dumbledore up to said Scrimgeour brusquely Where does he go when he is absent from Hogwarts No idea said Harry And you wouldnt tell me if you knew said Scrimgeour would you CHAPTER SIXTEEN 348 No I wouldnt said Harry Well then I shall have to see whether I cant find out by other means You can try said Harry indiffer ently But you seem cleverer than Fudge so Id have thought youd have learned from his mistakes He tried interfering at Hogwarts You might have noticed hes not Minister anymore but Dumbledores still headmaster Id leave Dumbledore alone if I were you There was a long pause Well it is clear to me that he has done a very good job on you said Scrimgeour his eyes cold and hard behind his wirerimmed glasses Dumbledores man through an d through arent you Potter Yeah I am said Harry Gla d we straightened that out And turning his back on the Minister of Magic he strode back toward the house S E V E N T E E N 349 A SLUGGISH MEMOR Y ate in the afternoon a few days after New Year Harry Ron and Ginny lined up beside the ki tchen fire to return to Hogwarts The Ministry had arranged this oneoff connection to the Floo Network to return students qu ickly and safely to the school Only Mrs Weasley was there to say goodbye as Mr Weasley Fred George Bill and Fleur were all at work Mrs Weasley dissolved into tears at the moment of parting Admittedly it took very little to set her off lately she had been crying on and off ever since Percy had stormed from the hous e on Christmas Day with his glasses splattered with mashed parsnip for which Fred George and Ginny all claimed credit Dont cry Mum said Ginny pa tting her on the back as Mrs Weasley sobbed into her shoulder Its okay Yeah dont worry about us said Ron permitting his mother to plant a very wet kiss on his cheek or about Percy Hes such a prat its not really a loss is it L CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 350 Mrs Weasley sobbed harder than ever as she enfolded Harry in her arms Promise me youll look after your self Stay out of trouble I always do Mrs Weasley said Harry I like a quiet life you know me She gave a watery chuckle and sto od back Be good then all of you Harry stepped into the emerald fire and shouted Hogwarts He had one last fleeting view of the Weasleys kitchen and Mrs Weasleys tearful face before the flames engulfed him spinning very fast he caught blurred glimpses of other Wizarding rooms which were whipped out of sight before he could get a proper look then he was slowing down finally stoppi ng squarely in the fireplace in Professor McGonagalls office She barely glanced up from her work as he clambered out over the grate Evening Potter Try not to get too much ash on the carpet No Professor Harry straightened his glasses and flattened his hair as Ron came spinning into view When Ginny ha d arrived all three of them trooped out of McGonagalls offi ce and off toward Gryffindor Tower Harry glanced out of the corridor windows as they passed the sun was already sinking over grounds carpeted in deeper snow than had lain over the Burrow gard en In the distance he could see Hagrid feeding Buckbeak in front of his cabin Baubles said Ron confidently when they reached the Fat Lady who was looking rather pale r than usual and winced at his loud voice No she said A SLUGGISH MEMORY 351 What dyou mean no There is a new password she said And please dont shout But weve been away howre we supposed to Harry Ginny Hermione was hurrying toward th em very pinkfaced and wearing a cloak hat and gloves I got back a couple of hours ago Ive just been down to visit Hagrid and Buck I mean Wither wings she said breathlessly Did you have a good Christmas Yeah said Ron at once pre tty eventful Rufus Scrim Ive got something for you Harry said Hermione neither looking at Ron nor giving any sign that she had heard him Oh hang on password Abstinence Precisely said the Fat Lady in a feeble voice and swung forward to reveal the portrait hole Whats up with her asked Harry Overindulged over Christmas apparently said Hermione rolling her eyes as she led the wa y into the packed common room She and her friend Violet drank their way through all the wine in that picture of drunk monk s down by the Charms corridor Anyway She rummaged in her pocket fo r a moment then pulled out a scroll of parchment with Du mbledores writing on it Great said Harry unrolling it at once to discover that his next lesson with Dumbledore was scheduled for the following night Ive got loads to tell him and you Lets sit down But at that moment there was a loud squeal of WonWon and Lavender Brown came hurtling out of nowhere and flung herself into Rons arms Several onlook ers sniggered Hermione gave a CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 352 tinkling laugh and said Theres a table over here Coming Ginny No thanks I said Id meet Dean said Ginny though Harry could not help noticing that she did not sound very enthusiastic Leaving Ron and Lavender locked in a kind of vertical wrestling match Harry led Hermione over to the spare table So how was your Christmas Oh fine she shrugged Nothin g special How was it at WonWons Ill tell you in a minute sa id Harry Look Hermione cant you No I cant she said fl atly So dont even ask I thought maybe you kn ow over Christmas It was the Fat Lady who drank a vat of fivehundredyearold wine Harry not me So what was this important news you wanted to tell me She looked too fierce to argue with at that moment so Harry dropped the subject of Ron and reco unted all that he had overheard between Malfoy and Snape When he had finished Hermione sat in thought for a moment and then said Dont you think he was pretending to offer he lp so that he could trick Malfoy into telling him what hes doing Well yes said Hermione Rons dad and Lupin think so Harry said grudgingly But this definitely proves Malfoys pl anning something you cant deny that No I cant she answered slowly And hes acting on Voldemort s orders just like I said A SLUGGISH MEMORY 353 Hmm did either of them actually mention Voldemorts name Harry frowned trying to rememb er Im not sure Snape definitely said your master and who else wo uld that be I dont know said Hermione biting her lip Maybe his father She stared across the room apparently lost in thought not even noticing Lavender tickli ng Ron Hows Lupin Not great said Harry and he told her all about Lupins mission among the werewolves and the diffic ulties he was facing Have you heard of this Fe nrir Greyback Yes I have said Hermione so unding startled And so have you Harry When History of Magic You know full well I never listened No no not History of Magic Malfoy threatened Borgin with him said Hermione Back in Knockturn Alley dont you remember He told Borgin that Greyback was an old family friend and that hed be checking up on Borgins progress Harry gaped at her I forgot But this proves Malfoys a Death Eater how else could he be in contact with Greyback and telling him what to do It is pretty suspicious breathed Hermione Unless Oh come on said Harry in ex asperation you cant get round this one Well there is the possibility it was an empty threat Youre unbelievable you are said Harry shaking his head Well see whos right Youll be eating your words Hermione CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 354 just like the Ministry Oh yeah I had a row with Rufus Scrimgeour as well And the rest of the evening passed amicably with both of them abusing the Minister of Magic for Hermione like Ron thought that after all the Ministry had pu t Harry through the previous year they had a great deal of nerv e asking him for help now The new term started next morning with a pleasant surprise for the sixth years a large sign had been pinned to the common room notice boards overnight APPARITION LESSONS If you are seventeen years of ag e or will turn seventeen on or before the 31st August next you are eligible for a twelveweek course of Apparition Lessons from a Ministry of Magic Apparition inst ructor Please sign below if you would like to particip ate Cost 12 Galleons Harry and Ron joined the crowd th at was jostling around the notice and taking it in turns to write their names at the bottom Ron was just taking out his quill to sign after Hermione when Lavender crept up behind him sli pped her hands over his eyes and trilled Guess who WonWon Harry turned to see Hermione stalking off he caught up with he r having no wish to stay behind with Ron and Lavender but to his surprise Ron caught up with them only a little way beyond the portrait hole his ears bright red and his expression di sgruntled Without a word Hermione sped up to walk with Neville So Apparition said Ron his tone making it perfectly plain A SLUGGISH MEMORY 355 that Harry was not to mention wh at had just ha ppened Should be a laugh eh I dunno said Harry Maybe its better when you do it yourself I didnt enjoy it much wh en Dumbledore took me along for the ride I forgot youd already done it Id better pass my test first time said Ron looking anxi ous Fred and George did Charlie failed th ough didnt he Yeah but Charlies bigger than me Ron held his arms out from his body as though he was a gorilla so Fred and George didnt go on about it much not to his face anyway When can we take the actual test Soon as were seventeen Thats only March for me Yeah but you wouldnt be able to Apparate in here not in the castle Not the point is it Everyone would know I could Apparate if I wanted Ron was not the only one to be excited at the prospect of Apparition All that day there was much talk about the forthcoming lessons a great deal of store was set by being able to vanish and reappear at will How cool will it be when we can just Seamus clicked his fingers to indicate disappearance M e cousin Fergus does it just to annoy me you wait till I can do it back Hell never have another peaceful moment Lost in visions of th is happy prospect he flicked his wand a little too enthusiastically so that in stead of producing the fountain of pure water that was the object of todays Charms lesson he let out CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 356 a hoselike jet that ricocheted o ff the ceiling and knocked Professor Flitwick flat on his face Harrys already Apparated Ron told a slightly abashed Seamus after Professor Flitwick had dried himself off with a wave of his wand and set Seamus lines I am a wizard not a baboon brandishing a stick Dum er someone took him SideAlongApparition you know Whoa whispered Seamus and he Dean and Neville put their heads a little closer to hear what Apparition felt like For the rest of the day Harry was besieged with requests from the other sixth years to describe the sensation of Apparition All of them seemed awed rather than put off when he told them how uncomfortable it was and he was still answering detailed questions at ten to eight that evening when he was forced to lie and say that he needed to return a book to the library so as to escape in time for his lesson with Dumbledore The lamps in Dumbledores office were lit the portraits of previous headmasters were snoring gently in their frames and the Pensieve was ready upon the desk on ce more Dumbledores hands lay on either side of it the right o ne as blackened and burntlooking as ever It did not seem to have he aled at all and Harry wondered for perhaps the hundredth time what ha d caused such a distinctive injury but did not ask Dumbledore had said that he would know eventually and there was in any ca se another subject he wanted to discuss But before Harry could say anything about Snape and Malfoy Dumbledore spoke I hear that you met the Minist er of Magic over Christmas Yes said Harry Hes not very happ y with me A SLUGGISH MEMORY 357 No sighed Dumbledore He is not very happy with me either We must try not to sink beneath our anguish Harry but battle on Harry grinned He wanted me to tell the Wi zarding community that the Ministrys doing a wonderful job Dumbledore smiled It was Fudges idea originally yo u know During his last days in office when he was trying desper ately to cling to his post he sought a meeting with you hoping that you would give him your support After everything Fudge did last year said Harry angrily After Umbridge I told Cornelius there was no ch ance of it but the idea did not die when he left office Within hours of Scrimgeours appointment we met and he demanded that I arrange a meeting with you So thats why you argued Har ry blurted out It was in the Daily Prophet The Prophet is bound to report the truth occasionally said Dumbledore if only accidentally Yes that was why we argued Well it appears that Rufus found a way to corner you at last He accused me of being Dumbledores man through and through How very rude of him I told him I was Dumbledore opened his mouth to speak and then closed it again Behind Harry Fawkes the ph oenix let out a low soft musical cry To Harrys in tense embarrassment he suddenly realized CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 358 that Dumbledores bright blue eyes looked rather watery and stared hastily at hi s own knees When Du mbledore spoke however his voice was quite steady I am very touched Harry Scrimgeour wanted to know where you go when youre not at Hogwarts said Harry still looking fixedly at his knees Yes he is very nosy about that said Dumbledore now sounding cheerful and Harry thought it safe to look up again He has even attempted to have me followed Amusing really He set Dawlish to tail me It wasnt kind I have alre ady been forced to jinx Dawlish once I did it again with the greatest regret So they still dont know where you go asked Harry hoping for more information on this intr iguing subject but Dumbledore merely smiled over the top of his halfmoon spectacles No they dont and the time is not quite right for you to know either Now I suggest we press on unless theres anything else There is actually sir said Harry Its about Malfoy and Snape Professor Snape Harry Yes sir I overheard them during Professor Slughorns party well I followed them actually Dumbledore listened to Harrys st ory with an impassive face When Harry had finished he di d not speak for a few moments then said Thank you for telling me this Harry but I suggest that you put it out of your mind I do not think that it is of great importance Not of great importance repe ated Harry incredulously Professor did you understand Yes Harry blessed as I am with extraordinary brainpower I A SLUGGISH MEMORY 359 understood everything you told me said Dumbledore a little sharply I think you might even co nsider the possibility that I understood more than you did Again I am glad that you have confided in me but let me reassure you that you have not told me anything that causes me disquiet Harry sat in seething silence gl aring at Dumbledore What was going on Did this mean that Dumbledore had indeed ordered Snape to find out what Malfoy was doing in which case he had already heard everything Harry had just told him from Snape Or was he really worried by what he had heard but pretending not to be So sir said Harry in what he hoped was a polite calm voice you definitely still trust I have been tolerant enough to answer that question already said Dumbledore but he did no t sound very tolerant anymore My answer has not changed I should think not said a snid e voice Phineas Nigellus was evidently only pretending to be asleep Dumbledore ignored him And now Harry I must insist th at we press on I have more important things to discuss with you this evening Harry sat there feeling mutinous Ho w would it be if he refused to permit the change of subject if he insisted upon arguing the case against Malfoy As though he had read Harrys mind Dumbledore shook his head Ah Harry how often this happe ns even between the best of friends Each of us believes that what he has to say is much more important than anything the othe r might have to contribute I dont think what youve got to say is unimport ant sir said Harry stiffly CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 360 Well you are quite right because it is not said Dumbledore briskly I have two more memories to show you this evening both obtained with enormous difficulty and the second of them is I think the most import ant I have collected Harry did not say anything to this he still felt an gry at the reception his confidences had received but could not see what was to be gained by arguing further So said Dumbledore in a ring ing voice we meet this evening to continue the ta le of Tom Riddle whom we left last lesson poised on the threshold of his years at Hogwarts You will remember how excited he was to hear that he was a wizard that he refused my company on a trip to Diagon Alley and that I in turn warned him against continued thievery when he arrived at school Well the start of the school ye ar arrived and with it came Tom Riddle a quiet boy in his secondhand robes who lined up with the other first years to be sorted He was placed in Slytherin House almost the moment that the Sortin g Hat touched his head continued Dumbledore waving his black ened hand toward the shelf over his head where the Sorting Hat sa t ancient and unmoving How soon Riddle learned that the famous founder of the House could talk to snakes I do not know perhaps that very evening The knowledge can only have excited him and increase d his sense of selfimportance However if he was frightening or impressing fellow Slytherins with displays of Parseltongue in their common room no hint of it reached the staff He showed no sign of outward arrogance or aggression at all As an unusuall y talented and very goodlooking orphan he naturally drew attention and sympathy from the staff almost from the moment of his a rrival He seemed polite quiet A SLUGGISH MEMORY 361 and thirsty for knowledge Nearly all were most favorably impressed by him Didnt you tell them sir what hed been like when you met him at the orphanage asked Harry No I did not Though he had shown no hint of remorse it was possible that he felt sorry for ho w he had behaved before and was resolved to turn over a fresh leaf I chose to give him that chance Dumbledore paused and looked inquiringly at Harry who had opened his mouth to speak Here again was Dumbledores tendency to trust people in spite of overwhelming evidence that they did not deserve it But then Harr y remembered something But you didnt really trust him sir did you He told me the Riddle who came out of that diary said Dumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the other teachers did Let us say that I did not take it for granted that he was trustworthy said Dumbledore I had as I have already indicated resolved to keep a close eye upon hi m and so I did I cannot pretend that I gleaned a great deal from my observations at first He was very guarded with me he felt I am sure that in the thrill of discovering his true identity he had told me a little too much He was careful never to reveal as much ag ain but he could not take back what he had let slip in his excite ment nor what Mrs Cole had confided in me However he had the sense never to try and charm me as he charmed so many of my colleagues As he moved up the school he gathered about him a group of dedicated friends I call them that for want of a better term although as I have already indica ted Riddle undoubtedly felt no affection for any of them This group had a kind of dark glamour within the castle They were a mo tley collection a mixture of the CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 362 weak seeking protection the ambiti ous seeking some shared glory and the thuggish gravitating toward a leader who could show them more refined forms of cruelty In other words they were the forerunners of the Death Eaters and in deed some of them became the first Death Eaters after leaving Hogwarts Rigidly controlled by Riddle th ey were never detected in open wrongdoing although their seven years at Hogwarts were marked by a number of nasty incidents to which they were never satisfactorily linked the most serious of which was of course the opening of the Chamber of Secrets which re sulted in the death of a girl As you know Hagrid was wrongl y accused of that crime I have not been able to find many memories of Riddle at Hogwarts said Dumbledore placing his withered hand on the Pensieve Few who knew him then ar e prepared to talk about him they are too terrified What I know I found out after he had left Hogwarts after much painstakin g effort after tracing those few who could be tricked into speaking after searching old records and questioning Muggle and wi zard witnesses alike Those whom I could persuade to talk told me that Riddle was obsessed with his parent age This is understandable of course he had grown up in an orphanage an d naturally wished to know how he came to be there It seems that he searched in vain for some trace of Tom Riddle senior on the shields in the trophy room on the lists of prefects in th e old school records ev en in the books of Wizarding history Finally he was forc ed to accept that his father had never set foot in Hogwarts I believe that it was then that he dropped the name forever assume d the identity of Lord Voldemort and began his investigations into his previously despised A SLUGGISH MEMORY 363 mothers family the woman wh om you will remember he had thought could not be a witch if she had su ccumbed to the shameful human weakne ss of death All he had to go upon was the single name Marvolo which he knew from those who ran the orph anage had been his mothers fathers name Finally after painst aking research th rough old books of Wizarding families he discover ed the existence of Slytherins surviving line In the summer of his sixteenth year he left the orphanage to which he re turned annually and set off to find his Gaunt relatives And now Harry if you will stand Dumbledore rose and Harry saw that he was again holding a small crystal bottle filled wi th swirling pearly memory I was very lucky to collect this he said as he poured the gleaming mass into the Pensieve As you will understand when we have experienced it Shall we Harry stepped up to the stone ba sin and bowed obediently until his face sank through the surface of the memory he felt the familiar sensation of falling through no thingness and then landed upon a dirty stone floor in almost total darkness It took him several seconds to re cognize the place by which time Dumbledore had landed beside him The Gaunts house was now more indescribably filthy than an ywhere Harry had ever seen The ceiling was thick with cobwebs th e floor coated in grime moldy and rotting food lay upon the tabl e amidst a mass of crusted pots The only light came fr om a single guttering candle placed at the feet of a man with hair and be ard so overgrown Harry could see neither eyes nor mouth He was slumped in an armchair by the fire and Harry wondered for a moment whether he was dead But CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 364 then there came a loud knock on the door and the man jerked awake raising a wand in his righ t hand and a short knife in his left The door creaked open There on the threshold holding an oldfashioned lamp stood a boy Harry re cognized at once tall pale darkhaired and handsome the teenage Voldemort Voldemorts eyes moved slowly around the hovel and then found the man in the armchair For a fe w seconds they looked at each other then the man staggered upri ght the many empty bottles at his feet clattering and tinkling across the floor YOU he bellowed YOU And he hurtled drunkenly at Ridd le wand and knife held aloft Stop Riddle spoke in Parseltongue The man skidded into the table sending moldy pots crashing to the floor He stared at Riddle There was a long silence while they contemplated each other The man broke it You speak it Yes I speak it said Riddle He moved forward into the room allowing the door to swing shut behind him Harry could not help but feel a resentful admiration fo r Voldemorts complete lack of fear His face merely expressed disgust and perhaps disappointment Where is Marvolo he asked Dead said the other Died years ago didnt he Riddle frowned Who are you then Im Morfin aint I A SLUGGISH MEMORY 365 Marvolos son Course I am then Morfin pushed the hair out of his dirty face the better to see Riddle and Harry saw th at he wore Marvolos blackstoned ring on his right hand I thought you was that Muggle whispered Morfin You look mighty like that Muggle What Muggle said Riddle sharply That Muggle what my sister took a fancy to that Muggle what lives in the big house over the way said Morfin and he spat unexpectedly upon the floor between them You look right like him Riddle But hes older now in e Hes ol dern you now I think on it Morfin looked slightly dazed and swayed a little still clutching the edge of the table for support He come back see he added stupidly Voldemort was gazing at Morfin as though appraising his possibilities Now he moved a little closer and said Riddle came back Ar he left her and serve her right marrying filth said Morfin spitting on the floor again Robbed us mind before she ran off Wheres the locket eh wheres Slytherins locket Voldemort did not answer Morfin was working himself into a rage again he brandished his knife and shouted Dishonored us she did that little slut And whore you coming here and asking questions about all that Its over innit Its over He looked away staggering sl ightly and Voldemort moved forward As he did so an unnatural darkness fell extinguishing Voldemorts lamp and Morfins candle extinguishing ev erything Dumbledores fingers closed ti ghtly around Harrys arm and CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 366 they were soaring back into the present again The soft golden light in Dumbledores office seemed to dazzle Harrys eyes after that impenetrable darkness Is that all said Harry at once Why did it go dark what happened Because Morfin could not remember anything from that point onward said Dumbledore gesturing Harry back into his seat When he awoke next morning he was lying on the floor quite alone Marvolos ring had gone Meanwhile in the village of Little Hangleton a maid was running along the High Street scream ing that there were three bodies lying in the drawing room of the big house Tom Riddle Senior and his mother and father The Muggle authorities were perplexed As far as I am aware they do not know to this day how the Riddles died for the Avada Kedavra curse does not usually leave an y sign of damage The exception sits before me Du mbledore added with a nod to Harrys scar The Ministry on the other hand knew at once that this was a wizards murder They also knew that a convicted Mugglehater lived across the valley from the Riddle house a Mugglehater who had already been imprisoned once for attacking one of the murdered people So the Ministry called upon Morfin They did not need to question him to use Veritaserum or Legilimency He admitted to the murder on the spot giving details only the murderer could know He was proud he said to have killed the Muggles had been awaiting his chance all these ye ars He handed over his wand wh ic h w a s pro ved a t o nc e t o h a ve be e n us ed to k i l l t h e Ridd l es And he permitted himself to be led off to Azkaban without a fight A SLUGGISH MEMORY 367 All that disturbed him was the fact that his fathers ring had disappeared Hell kill me for losing it he told his captors over and over again Hell kill me for losing his ring And that apparently was all he ever said again He lived ou t the remainder of his life in Azkaban lamenting the loss of Marvolo s last heirloom and is buried beside the prison alongside the ot her poor souls who have expired within its walls So Voldemort stole Morfins wand and used it said Harry sitting up straight Thats right said Dumbledore We have no memories to show us this but I think we ca n be fairly sure what happened Voldemort Stupefied his uncle took his wand and proceeded across the valley to the big house over the way There he murdered the Muggle man who had abandoned his witch mother and for good measure his Muggle grandparents thus ob literating the last of the unworthy Riddle line and re venging himself upon the father who never wanted him Then he re turned to the Gaunt hovel performed the complex bi t of magic that would implant a false memory in his uncles mind laid Morfins wand beside its unconscious owner pocketed the ancient ri ng he wore and departed And Morfin never realized he hadnt done it Never said Dumbledore He gave as I say a full and boastful confession But he had this real memory in him all the time Yes but it took a great deal of skilled Legilimency to coax it out of him said Dumbledore and wh y should anybody delve further into Morfins mind when he had already confessed to the crime However I was able to secure a visi t to Morfin in the last weeks of his life by which time I was attemp ting to discover as much as I CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 368 could about Voldemorts past I extracted this memory with difficulty When I saw what it contained I attempted to use it to secure Morfins release from Azkaban Before the Ministry reached their decision however Morfin had died But how come the Ministry didn t realize that Voldemort had done all that to Morfin Harry as ked angrily He was underage at the time wasnt he I thought they could detect underage magic You are quite right they can detect magic but not the perpetrator You will remember that you were blamed by the Ministry for the Hover Charm that wa s in fact cast by Dobby growled Harry this injust ice still rankled So if youre underage and you do magic inside an adult witch or wizards house the Ministry wont know They will certainly be unable to tell who performed the magic said Dumbledore smiling slightly at the look of great indignation on Harrys face They rely on wi tch and wizard parents to enforce their offsprings obedience while within their walls Well thats rubbish snap ped Harry Look what happened here look what happened to Morfin I agree said Dumbledore Whatever Morfin was he did not deserve to die as he did blam ed for murders he had not committed But it is getting late and I want you to see this other memory before we part Dumbledore took from an inside pocket another crystal phial and Harry fell silent at once re membering that Dumbledore had said it was the most important one he had collected Harry noticed that the contents proved difficult to empty into the Pensieve as though they had congealed slig htly did memories go bad This will not take long said Dumbledore when he had finally A SLUGGISH MEMORY 369 emptied the phial We shall be back before you know it Once more into the Pensieve then And Harry fell again through the silv er surface landing this time right in front of a man he recognized at once It was a much younger Horace Slughorn Harry was so used to him bald that he found the sight of Slughorn with thick shiny strawcolored hair quite disconcertin g it looked as though he had had his head thatched though there was already a shiny Galleonsized bald patch on his crown Hi s mustache less massive than it was these days was gingeryblond He was not quite as rotund as the Slughorn Harry knew though the golden buttons on his richly embroidered waistcoat were taking a fair amount of strain His little feet resting upon a velvet pouffe he was sitting well back in a comfortable winged armchair one hand grasping a small glass of wine the other searchin g through a box of cr ystalized pineapple Harry looked around as Dumbledore appeared beside him and saw that they were stan ding in Slughorns of fice Half a dozen boys were sitting around Slughorn all on harder or lower seats than his and all in their midteens Har ry recognized Vold emort at once His was the most handsome face an d he looked the most relaxed of all the boys His right hand lay negligently upon the arm of his chair with a jolt Harry saw that he was wearing Marvolos goldandblack ring he had al ready killed his father Sir is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring he asked Tom Tom if I knew I couldnt tell you said Slughorn wagging a reproving sugarcovered fi nger at Riddle though ruining the effect slightly by winking I must say Id like to know where you get your information boy more knowledgeable than half the staff you are CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 370 Riddle smiled the other boys la ughed and cast him admiring looks What with your uncanny ability to know things you shouldnt and your careful flattery of the people who matter thank you for the pineapple by the way youre quite right it is my favorite As several of the boys titt ered something very odd happened The whole room was suddenly filled with a thick white fog so that Harry could see nothing but the face of Dumbledore who was standing beside him Then Slughorns voice rang out through the mist unnaturally loudly Youll go wrong boy mark my words The fog cleared as suddenly as it had appeared and yet nobody made any allusion to it nor did anybody look as though anything unusual had just happened Bewildered Harry looked around as a small golden clock standing upon Slughorns desk chimed eleven oclock Good gracious is it that time already said Slughorn Youd better get going boys or well all be in trouble Lestrange I want your essay by tomorrow or its detention Same goes for you Avery Slughorn pulled himself out of his armchair and carried his empty glass over to his desk as th e boys filed out Voldemort however stayed behind Harry could tell he had dawdled deliberately wanting to be last in the room with Slughorn Look sharp Tom said Slughorn turning around and finding him still present You dont want to be caught out of bed out of hours and you a prefect Sir I wanted to ask you something Ask away then mboy ask away Sir I wondered what you know about ab out Horcruxes And it happened all over again The dense fog filled the room A SLUGGISH MEMORY 371 so that Harry could not see Slugho rn or Voldemort at all only Dumbledore smiling serenely besi de him Then Slughorns voice boomed out again just as it had done before I dont know anything about Horcruxes and I wouldnt tell you if I did Now get out of here at once and dont let me catch you mentioning them again Well thats that said Du mbledore placidly beside Harry Time to go And Harrys feet left the floor to fa ll seconds later back onto the rug in front of Dumbledores desk Thats all there is said Harry blankly Dumbledore had said that this was the most important memory of all but he could not see what was so significant about it Admittedly the fog and the fact that nobody seemed to have noticed it was odd but other than that nothing seemed to have happened except that Voldemort had asked a question and failed to get an answer As you might have noticed sa id Dumbledore reseating himself behind his desk that memo ry has been tampered with Tampered with repe ated Harry sittin g back down too Certainly said Dumbledore Professor Slughorn has meddled with his own recollections But why would he do that Because I think he is ashame d of what he remembers said Dumbledore He has tried to rework the memory to show himself in a better light obliterating those parts which he does not wish me to see It is as you will have noticed very crudely done and that is all to the good for it shows that the true memory is still there beneath the alterations CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 372 And so for the first time I am giving you homework Harry It will be your job to persuade Prof essor Slughorn to divulge the real memory which will undoubtedly be our most crucial piece of information of all Harry stared at him But surely sir he said keepin g his voice as respectful as possible you dont need me you could use Legilimency or Veritaserum Professor Slughorn is an extremel y able wizard who will be expecting both said Dumbledore He is much more accomplished at Occlumency than poor Morfin Gaunt and I would be astonished if he has not carried an antidote to Veritaserum with him ever since I coerced him into giving me this travesty of a recollection No I think it would be foolish to attempt to wrest the truth from Professor Slughorn by forc e and might do much more harm than good I do not wish him to leave Hogwarts However he has his weaknesses like the rest of us and I believe that you are the one person who might be able to penetr ate his defenses It is most important that we secure the true memory Harry How important we will only know when we have seen the real thing So good luck and good night A little taken ab ack by the abrupt dismi ssal Harry got to his feet quickly Good night sir As he closed the study door behind him he distinctly heard Phineas Nigellus say I cant see why the boy should be able to do it better than you Dumbledore I wouldnt expect you to Phineas replied Dumbledore and Fawkes gave another low musical cry E I G H T E E N 373 BIRTHDAY SURPRISES he next day Harry confided in both Ron and Hermione the task that Dumbledore had set him though separately for Hermione still refused to remain in Rons presence longer than it took to give him a contemptuous look Ron thought that Harry was unlikely to have any trouble with Slughorn at all He loves you he said over breakf ast waving an airy forkful of fried egg Wont refuse you anythi ng will he Not his little Potions Prince Just hang back after class this afternoon and ask him Hermione however took a gloom ier view He must be determined to hide what really happene d if Dumbledore couldnt get it out of him she said in a low voic e as they stood in the deserted snowy courtyard at break Horcruxes Horcruxes Ive never even heard of them You havent Harry was disappointed he had hoped that T CHAPTER EIGHTEEN 374 Hermione might have been able to give him a clue as to what Horcruxes were T h e y m u s t b e r e a l l y a d v a n c e d D a r k M a g i c o r w h y w o u l d Voldemort have wanted to know about them I think its going to be difficult to get the informatio n Harry youll have to be very careful about how you approach Slughorn think out a strategy Ron reckons I should just hang back after Potions this afternoon Oh well if WonWon thinks that youd better do it she said flaring up at once After all when has WonWons judgment ever been faulty Hermione cant you No she said angrily and stormed away leaving Harry alone and ankledeep in snow Potions lessons were uncomfortable enough these days seeing as Harry Ron and Hermione had to share a desk Today Hermione moved her cauldron around the table so that she was close to Ernie and ignored both Harry and Ron Whatve you done Ron muttered to Harry looking at Hermiones haughty profile But before Harry could answer Sl ughorn was calling for silence from the front of the room Settle down settle down please Quickly now lots of work to get through this afternoon Golpalo tts Third Law who can tell me But Miss Granger can of course Hermione recited at top speed GolpalottsThirdLawstatesthattheantidoteforablendedpo isonwillbeequaltomorethanthesumoftheantidotesforeac hoftheseparatecomponents BIRTHDAY SURPRISES 375 Precisely beamed Slughorn Ten points for Gryffindor Now if we accept Golpalotts Third Law as true Harry was going to have to take Sl ughorns word for it that Golpalotts Third Law was true beca use he had not understood any of it Nobody apart from Hermione seemed to be following what Slughorn said next either which means of course that assuming we have achieved correct identification of the potion s ingredients by Scarpins Revelaspell our primary aim is not the relatively simple one of selecting antidotes to those ingredients in an d of themselves but to find that added component that will by an almost alchemical process transform these disparate elements Ron was sitting beside Harry with his mouth half open doodling absently on his new copy of Advanced PotionMaking Ron kept forgetting that he could no longer rely on Hermione to help him out of trouble when he fail ed to grasp what was going on and so finished Slughorn I want each of you to come and take one of these phials from my desk You are to create an antidote for the poison within it be fore the end of the lesson Good luck and dont forget your protective gloves Hermione had left her stool and was halfway toward Slughorns desk before the rest of the class had realized it was time to move and by the time Harry Ron and Er nie returned to the table she had already tipped the contents of her phial into her cauldron and was kindling a fire underneath it Its a shame that the Prince wont be able to help you much with this Harry she said brightly as she straightened up You have to understand the principles involved this time No shortcuts or cheats CHAPTER EIGHTEEN 376 Annoyed Harry uncorked the poison he had taken from Slughorns desk which was a garish shade of pink tipped it into his cauldron and lit a fire underneath it He did not have the faintest idea what he was supposed to do nex t He glanced around at Ron who was now standing there look ing rather gormless having copied everything Harry had done You sure the Prince hasnt got any tips Ron muttered to Harry Harry pulled out his trusty copy of Advanced PotionMaking and turned to the chapter on antidotes There was Golpalotts Third Law stated word for word as Hermione had recited it but not a single illuminating note in the Pr inces hand to explain what it meant Apparently th e Prince like Hermio ne had had no difficulty understanding it Nothing said Harry gloomily Hermione was now waving her wa nd enthusiastically over her cauldron Unfortunately they co uld not copy the spell she was doing because she was now so good at nonverbal incantations that she did not need to say the words aloud Ernie Macmillan however was muttering Specialis Revelio over his cauldron which sounded impressive so Har ry and Ron hastened to imitate him It took Harry only five minutes to realize that his reputation as the best potionmaker in the cl ass was crashing around his ears Slughorn had peered hopefully into his cauldron on his first circuit of the dungeon preparing to exclai m in delight as he usually did and instead had withdrawn his head hastily coughing as the smell of bad eggs overwhelmed him He rmiones expression could not have been any smugger she had loathed being outperformed in every Potions class She was now decanting the mysteriously sepaBIRTHDAY SURPRISES 377 rated ingredients of her poison into ten different crystal phials More to avoid watching this irritating sight than anything else Harry bent over the HalfBlood Pr inces book and turned a few pages with unnecessary force And there it was scrawled right across a long list of antidotes Just shove a bezoar down their throats Harry stared at these words for a moment Hadnt he once long ago heard of bezoars Hadnt Sn ape mentioned them in their firstever Potions lesson A stone taken from the st omach of a goat which will protect from most poisons It was not an answer to the Golpalott problem and had Snape still been their teacher Harry woul d not have dared do it but this was a moment for desperate meas ures He hastened toward the store cupboard and rummaged wi thin it pushing aside unicorn horns and tangles of dried herbs until he found at the very back a small cardboard box on which had been scribbled the word bezoars He opened the box just as Slughorn called Two minutes left everyone Inside were half a do zen shriveled brown objects looking more like driedup kidneys than real stones Harry seized one put the box back in the cupboard and hu rried back to his cauldron Times UP called Slughorn genially Well lets see how youve done Blaise what have you got for me Slowly Slughorn moved around the room examining the various antidotes Nobody had finished the task although Hermione was trying to cram a few more ingredients into her bottle before CHAPTER EIGHTEEN 378 Slughorn reached her Ron had given up completely and was merely trying to avoid breathing in the putrid fumes issuing from his cauldron Harry stood there waitin g the bezoar clutched in a slightly sweaty hand Slughorn reached their table last He sniffed Ernies potion and passed on to Rons with a grimace He did not linger over Rons cauldron but backed away swiftly retching slightly And you Harry he said Wha t have you got to show me Harry held out his hand the bezoar sitting on his palm Slughorn looked down at it fo r a full ten seconds Harry wondered for a moment whether he was going to shout at him Then he threw back his head an d roared with laughter Youve got nerve boy he boomed taking the bezoar and holding it up so that the class could s ee it Oh youre like your mother Well I cant fault you A bezoar would certainly act as an antidote to all these potions Hermione who was sweatyfaced and had soot on her nose looked livid Her halffinished an tidote comprising fiftytwo ingredients including a chunk of her own hair bubbled sluggishly behind Slughorn who had eyes for nobody but Harry And you thought of a bezoar al l by yourself did you Harry she asked through gritted teeth Thats the individual spirit a real potionmaker needs said Slughorn happily before Harry coul d reply Just like his mother she had the same intuitive grasp of potionmaking its undoubtedly from Lily he gets it Yes Harry yes if youve got a bezoar to hand of course that would do the trick although as they dont work on everything and are pr etty rare its still worth knowing how to mix antidotes BIRTHDAY SURPRISES 379 The only person in the room looking angrier than Hermione was Malfoy who Harry was pleased to see had spilled something that looked like catsick over him self Before either of them could express their fury that Harry had come top of the class by not doing any work howeve r the bell rang Time to pack up said Slughorn And an extra ten points to Gryffindor for sheer cheek Still chuckling he waddled back to his desk at the front of the dungeon Harry dawdled behind taking an in ordinate amount of time to do up his bag Neither Ron nor Herm ione wished him luck as they left both looked rather annoyed At last Harry and Slughorn were the only two left in the room Come on now Harry youll be la te for your next lesson said Slughorn affably snapping the gold clasps shut on his dragonskin briefcase Sir said Harry reminding himsel f irresistibly of Voldemort I wanted to ask you something Ask away then my dear boy ask away Sir I wondered what you know about ab out Horcruxes Slughorn froze His round face seem ed to sink in upon itself He licked his lips and said ho arsely What did you say I asked whether you know anything about Horcruxes sir You see Dumbledore put you up to t his whispered Slughorn His voice had changed completely It was not genial anymore but shocked terrified He fumbled in his breast pocket and pulled out a handkerchief mopping his swea ting brow Dumbledores shown you that that memory Well Hasn t he CHAPTER EIGHTEEN 380 Yes said Harry deciding on the spot that it was best not to lie Yes of course said Slughorn qu ietly still dabbing at his white face Of course well if youve seen that memory Harry youll know that I dont know anything anything he repeated the word forcefully about Horcruxes He seized his dragonskin brie fcase stuffed his handkerchief back into his pocket and ma rched to the dungeon door Sir said Harry desperately I just thought ther e might be a bit more to the memory Did you said Slughorn Then you were wrong werent you WRONG He bellowed the last word and before Harry could say another word slammed the dungeon door behind him Neither Ron nor Hermione was at all sympathetic when Harry told them of this disastrous interview Hermione was still seething at the way Harry had triumphed wi thout doing the work properly Ron was resentful that Harry hadn t slipped him a bezoar too It wouldve just looked stupid if wed both done it said Harry irritably Look I had to try and soften him up so I could ask him about Voldemort didn t I Oh will you get a grip he added in exasperation as Ron winced at the sound of the name Infuriated by his failure and by Rons and Hermiones attitudes Harry brooded for the next few days over what to do next about Slughorn He decided that for the time being he would let Slughorn think that he had forgotten al l about Horcruxes it was surely best to lull him into a false sense of security before returning to the attack When Harry did not question Sl ughorn again the Potions master reverted to his usual a ffectionate treatment of him and BIRTHDAY SURPRISES 381 appeared to have put the matter from his mind Harry awaited an invitation to one of his little evening parties determined to accept this time even if he had to reschedule Quidditch practice Unfortunately however no such invita tion arrived Harry checked with Hermione and Ginny Neither of th em had received an invitation and nor as far as they knew had anybody else Harry could not help wondering whether this meant that Slughorn was not quite as forgetful as he appear ed simply determined to give Harry no additional opportunities to question him Meanwhile the Hogwarts library had failed Hermione for the first time in living memory She was so shocked she even forgot that she was annoyed at Harry for his trick with the bezoar I havent found one single expl anation of what Horcruxes do she told him Not a single one Ive been right through the restricted section and even in the most horrible books where they tell you how to brew the most gruesome potions nothing All I could find was this in the introduction to Magick Moste Evile listen Of the Horcrux wickedest of ma gical inventions we shall not speak nor give direction I mean why mention it then she said impatiently slamming the old book shut it let out a ghostly wail Oh shut up she snapped stuffing it back into her bag The snow melted around the sch ool as February arrived to be replaced by cold dreary wetness Purplishgray clouds hung low over the castle and a constant fall of chilly rain made the lawns slippery and muddy The upshot of this was that the sixth years first Apparition lesson which was scheduled for a Saturday morning so that no normal lessons would be missed took place in the Great Hall instead of in the grounds When Harry and Hermione arrived in the Hall Ron had come CHAPTER EIGHTEEN 382 down with Lavender they found that the tables had disappeared Rain lashed against the high windows and the enchanted ceiling swirled darkly above them as they assembled in front of Professors McGonagall Snape Flitwick and Sprout the Heads of Houses and a small wizard whom Harry took to be the Apparition instructor from the Ministry He wa s oddly colorless with transparent eyelashes wispy hair and an insu bstantial air as though a single gust of wind might blow him away Harry wondered whether constant disappearances and reappe arances had somehow diminished his substance or whether this frail build was ideal for anyone wishing to vanish Good morning said the Ministry wizard when all the students had arrived and the Heads of Houses had called for quiet My name is Wilkie Twycross and I shall be your Ministry Apparition instructor for the next twelve weeks I hope to be able to prepare you for your Appariti on Tests in this time Malfoy be quiet and pay atte ntion barked Professor McGonagall Everybody looked around Malfoy had flushed a dull pink he looked furious as he stepped away from Crabbe with whom he appeared to have been having a w hispered argument Harry glanced quickly at Snape who also looked annoyed though Harry strongly suspected that this was less becaus e of Malfoys rudeness than the fact that McGonagall had re primanded one of his House b y w h i c h t i m e m a n y o f y o u may be ready to take your tests Twycross continued as th ough there had been no interruption As you may know it is usuall y impossible to Apparate or Disapparate within Hogwarts The headmaster has lifted this enBIRTHDAY SURPRISES 383 chantment purely within the Great Hall for one hour so as to enable you to practice May I emphas ize that you will not be able to Apparate outside the walls of this Hall and that you would be unwise to try I would like each of you to pl ace yourselves now so that you have a clear five feet of space in front of you There was a great scrambling and jostling as people separated banged into each other and ordere d others out of their space The Heads of Houses moved among th e students marshaling them into position and breaking up arguments Harry where are you goin g demanded Hermione But Harry did not answer he wa s moving quickly through the crowd past the place where Profe ssor Flitwick was making squeaky attempts to position a few Ravenc laws all of whom wanted to be near the front past Professor Sp rout who was chivying the Hufflepuffs into line until by dodg ing around Ernie Macmillan he managed to position himself right at the back of the crowd directly behind Malfoy who was taking ad vantage of the general upheaval to continue his argument with Cr abbe standing five feet away and looking mutinous I dont know how much longer all right Malfoy shot at him oblivious to Harry standing right be hind him Its taking longer than I thought it would Crabbe opened his mouth but Ma lfoy appeared to secondguess w h a t h e w a s g o i n g t o s a y L o o k i t s n o n e o f y o u r b u s i n e s s w h a t Im doing Crabbe you and Goyle just do as youre told and keep a lookout I tell my friends what Im up to if I want them to keep a lookout for me Harry said just loud enough for Malfoy to hear him CHAPTER EIGHTEEN 384 M a l f o y s p u n a r o u n d o n t h e s p o t h i s h a n d f l y i n g t o h i s w a n d but at that precise moment the four Heads of House shouted Quiet and silence fell again Ma lfoy turned slowly to face the front again Thank you said Twycro ss Now then He waved his wand Oldfashio ned wooden hoops instantly appeared on the floor in front of every student The important things to remember when Apparating are the three Ds said Twycross Desti nation Determination Deliberation Step one Fix your mind firmly upon the desired destination said Twycross In this case the interior of your hoop Kindly concentrate upon that destination now Everybody looked around furtivel y to check that everyone else was staring into their hoop then hastily did as they were told Harry gazed at the circular patch of dusty floor enclosed by his hoop and tried hard to think of nothing else This proved impossible as he couldnt stop puzzling over what Malfoy was doing that needed lookouts Step two said Twycross focus your determination to occupy the visualized space Let your year ning to enter it flood from your mind to every partic le of your body Harry glanced around surreptitiously A little way to his left Ernie Macmillan was contemplating hi s hoop so hard that his face had turned pink it looked as th ough he was straining to lay a Quafflesized egg Harry bit back a laugh and hastily returned his gaze to his own hoop Step three called Twycross and only when I give the com BIRTHDAY SURPRISES 385 mand Turn on the spot feeling your way into nothingness moving with deliberation On my command now one Harry glanced around again lots of people were looking positively alarmed at being aske d to Apparate so quickly two Harry tried to fix his thoughts on his hoop again he had already forgotten what the three Ds stood for THREE Harry spun on the spot lost balance and nearly fell over He was not the only one The whole Ha ll was suddenly full of staggering people Neville was flat on his back Ernie Macmillan on the other hand had done a ki nd of pirouetting leap into his hoop and looked momentarily thrilled un til he caught sight of Dean Thomas roaring with laughter at him Never mind never mind said Twycross dryly who did not seem to have expected anything be tter Adjust your hoops please and back to your origin al positions The second attempt was no better than the first The third was just as bad Not until the fourth did anything exciting happen There was a horrible screech of pain and everybody looked around terrified to see Susan Bones of Hufflepuff wobbling in her hoop with her left leg still standing fi ve feet away where she had started The Heads of House converged on her there was a great bang and a puff of purple smoke which cleared to reveal Susan sobbing reunited with her leg but looking horrified Splinching or the separation of random body parts said Wilkie Twycross dispassionately o ccurs when the mind is insufficiently determined You must concentrate continuously upon your CHAPTER EIGHTEEN 386 destination and move without haste but with deliberation thus Twycross stepped forward turned gr acefully on the spot with his arms outstretched and vanished in a swirl of robes reappearing at the back of the Hall Remember the three Ds he sa id and try again one two three But an hour later Susans Splinching was still the most interesting thing that had happened Twyc ross did not seem discouraged Fastening his cloak at his neck he merely said Until next Saturday everybody and do not forget Destination Determination Deliberation With that he waved his wand Va nishing the hoops and walked out of the Hall accompanied by Professor McGonagall Talk broke out at once as people began moving toward the entrance hall How did you do asked Ron hu rrying toward Harry I think I felt something the last time I tr ied a kind of tingling in my feet I expect your trainers are too small WonWon said a voice behind them and Hermione stalked past smirking I didnt feel anything said Ha rry ignoring this interruption But I dont care about that now What dyou mean you dont care Dont you want to learn to Apparate said Ron incredulously Im not fussed really I prefer fl ying said Harry glancing over his shoulder to see where Malfoy was and speeding up as they came into the entrance hall Look hurry up will you theres something I want to do Perplexed Ron followed Harry back to the Gryffindor Tower at BIRTHDAY SURPRISES 387 a run They were temporarily detained by Peeves who had jammed a door on the fourth floor shut an d was refusing to let anyone pass until they set fire to their ow n pants but Harry and Ron simply turned back and took one of their trusted shortcuts Within five minutes they were climbing through the portrait hole Are you going to tell me what were doing then asked Ron panting slightly Up here said Harry and he cr ossed the common room and led the way through the door to the boys staircase Their dormitory was as Harry had hoped empty He flung open his trunk and began to rummage in it while Ron watched impatiently Harry Malfoys using Crabbe and Goyl e as lookouts He was arguing with Crabbe just now I want to know aha He had found it a folded square of apparently blank parchment which he now smoothed out and ta pped with the tip of his wand I solemnly swear that I am up to no good or Malfoy is anyway At once the Marauders Map appeared on the parchments surface Here was a detailed plan of every one of the castles floors and moving around it the tiny labeled black dots that signified each of the castles occupants Help me find Malfoy said Harry urgently He laid the map upon his bed and he and Ron leaned over it searching There said Ron after a minute or so Hes in the Slytherin common room look with Pa rkinson and Zabini and Crabbe and Goyle CHAPTER EIGHTEEN 388 Harry looked down at the map di sappointed but rallied almost at once Well Im keeping an eye on him from now on he said firmly And the moment I see him lurking somewhere with Crabbe and Goyle keeping watch outside itll be on with the old Invisibility Cloak and off to find out what hes He broke off as Neville entered the dormitory bringing with him a strong smell of singed mate rial and began rummaging in his trunk for a fresh pair of pants Despite his determination to ca tch Malfoy out Harry had no luck at all over the next couple of weeks Although he consulted the map as often as he could someti mes making unnecessary visits to the bathroom between lessons to se arch it he did not once see Malfoy anywhere suspicious Admitted ly he spotted Crabbe and Goyle moving around the castle on their own more often than usual sometimes remaining stationary in deserted corridors but at these times Malfoy was not only nowher e near them bu t impossible to locate on the map at all This was most mysterious Harry toyed with the possibility that Malfoy was actually leaving the school grounds but could not see how he could be doing it given the very high level of security now operat ing within the castle He could only suppose that he was missing Malfoy amongst the hundreds of tiny black dots upon the map As for the fact that Malfoy Crabbe and Goyle appeared to be going their different ways when they were usually inseparable these things happened as people got older Ron and Hermione Harry re flected sadly were living proof February moved toward March with no change in the weather except that it became windy as well as wet To general indignation BIRTHDAY SURPRISES 389 a sign went up on all common room notice boards that the next trip into Hogsmeade had been canceled Ron was furious It was on my birthday he sa id I was looking forward to that Not a big surprise though is it said Harry Not after what happened to Katie She had still not returned from St Mungos What was more further disappearances had been reported in the Daily Prophet including several relatives of students at Hogwarts But now all Ive got to look forward to is stupid Apparition said Ron grumpily Big birthday treat Three lessons on Apparition was proving as difficult as ever though a few more people had managed to Splinch themselves Frustration was running high and th ere was a certain amount of illfeeling toward Wilkie Twycross an d his three Ds which had inspired a number of nicknames for him the politest of which were Dogbreath and Dunghead Happy birthday Ron said Harry when they were woken on the first of March by Seamus an d Dean leaving noisily for breakfast Have a present He threw the package across onto Rons bed where it joined a small pile of them that must Ha rry assumed have been delivered by houseelves in the night Cheers said Ron drowsily and as he ripped off the paper Harry got out of bed opened his own trunk and began rummaging in it for the Maraud ers Map which he hi d after every use He turfed out half the contents of his trunk before he found it hiding beneath the rolledup socks in whic h he was still keeping his bottle of lucky potion Felix Felicis CHAPTER EIGHTEEN 390 Right he murmured taking it back to bed with him tapping it quietly and murmuring I solemnly swear that I am up to no good so that Neville who was passi ng the foot of his bed at the time would not hear Nice one Harry said Ron en thusiastically waving the new pair of Quidditch Keepers gloves Harry had given him No problem said Harry absentmi ndedly as he searched the Slytherin dormitory closely for Malfoy Hey I dont think hes in his bed Ron did not answer he was too busy unwrapping presents every now and then letting out an exclamation of pleasure Seriously good haul this year he announced holding up a heavy gold watch with odd symbols around the edge and tiny moving stars instead of hands See what Mum and Dad got me Blimey I think Ill come of age next year too Cool muttered Harry sparing th e watch a glance before peering more closely at the map Wh ere was Malfoy He did not seem to be at the Slytherin table in the Great Hall eating breakfast He was nowhere near Snape who was sitting in his study He wasnt in any of the bathrooms or in the hospital wing Want one said Ron thickly holding out a box of Chocolate Cauldrons No thanks said Ha rry looking up Mal foys gone again Cant have done said Ron stuffing a second Cauldron into his mouth as he slid out of bed to get dressed Come on if you dont hurry up youll have to Apparate on an empty stomach Might make it easier I suppose Ro n looked thoughtfully at the box of Chocolate Cauldrons then sh rugged and helped himself to a third BIRTHDAY SURPRISES 391 Harry tapped the map with his wand muttered Mischief managed though it hadnt been and got dressed thinking hard There had to be an explanation for Malf oys periodic disappearances but he simply could not think what it could be The best way of finding out would be to tail him but even with the Invisibility Cloak this was an impractical idea Ha rry had lessons Quidditch practice homework and Apparition he could not follow Malfoy around school all day without his absence being remarked upon Ready he said to Ron He was halfway to the dormitory door when he realized that Ron had not moved but was leaning on his bedpost staring out of the rainwashed window with a st rangely unfocuse d look on his face Ron Breakfast Im not hungry Harry stared at him I thought you just said Well all right Ill come down with you sighed Ron but I dont want to eat Harry scrutinized him suspiciously Youve just eaten half a box of Chocolate Cauldrons havent you Its not that Ron sighed again You you wouldnt understand Fair enough said Harry albeit puzzled as he turned to open the door Harry said Ron suddenly What Harry I cant stand it CHAPTER EIGHTEEN 392 You cant stand what asked Ha rry now starting to feel definitely alarmed Ron was rather pa le and looked as though he was about to be sick I cant stop thin king about her said Ron hoarsely Harry gaped at him He had not ex pected this and was not sure he wanted to hear it Friends they might be but if Ron started calling Lavender LavLav he would have to put his foot down Why does that stop you having breakfast Harry asked trying to inject a note of common sense into the proceedings I dont think she knows I exist said Ron with a desperate gesture She definitely knows you exist said Harry bewildered She keeps snogging you doesnt she Ron blinked Who ar e you talking about Who are you talking about said Harry with an increasing sense that all reason had drop ped out of the conversation Romilda Vane said Ron softly and his whole face seemed to illuminate as he said it as though hit by a ray of purest sunlight They stared at each other for almost a whole minute before Harry said This is a joke right Youre joking I think Harry I think I love her said Ron in a strangled voice Okay said Harry walking up to Ron to get a better look at the glazed eyes and the pallid comple xion okay Say that again with a straig ht face I love her repeated Ron brea thlessly Have you seen her hair its all black and shin y and silky and he r eyes Her big dark eyes And her BIRTHDAY SURPRISES 393 This is really funny and ever ything said Harry impatiently but jokes over all right Drop it He turned to leave he had go t two steps toward the door when a crashing blow hit him on the ri ght ear Staggering he looked around Rons fist was drawn righ t back his face was contorted with rage he was abou t to strike again Harry reacted instinctively his wa nd was out of his pocket and the incantation sprang to mind without conscious thought Levicorpus Ron yelled as his heel was wrenc hed upward once more he dangled helplessly upside down his robes hanging off him What was that for Harry bellowed You insulted her Harry You sa id it was a joke shouted Ron who was slowly turning purple in th e face as all the blood rushed to his head This is insane said Harry Whats got into And then he saw the box lying open on Rons bed and the truth hit him with the force of a stampeding troll Where did you get those Chocolate Cauldrons They were a birthday present shouted Ron revolving slowly in midair as he struggled to get free I offered you one didnt I You just picked them up off the floor didnt you Theyd fallen off my bed all right Let me go They didnt fall off your bed you prat dont you understand They were mine I chucked them ou t of my trunk when I was looking for the map theyre the Choc olate Cauldrons Romilda gave me before Christmas and theyre al l spiked with love potion But only one word of this seemed to have registered with Ron CHAPTER EIGHTEEN 394 Romilda he repeated Did you say Romilda Harry do you know her Can you introduce me Harry stared at the dangling Ron whose face now looked tremendously hopeful and fought a strong desire to laugh A part of him the part closest to his throbbing right ear was quite keen on the idea of letting Ro n down and watching him run amok until the effects of the potion wore off But on the other hand they were supposed to be friend s Ron had not been himself when he had attacked and Harry thought that he would deserve another punching if he permitted Ron to declare undying love for Romilda Vane Yeah Ill introduce you said Harry thinking fast Im going to let you down now okay He sent Ron crashing back to the floor his ear did hurt quite a lot but Ron simply bounded to his feet again grinning Shell be in Slughorns office said Harry confidently leading the way to the door Why will she be in there as ked Ron anxiously hurrying to keep up Oh she has extra Potions lessons w i t h h i m s a i d H a r r y i n venting wildly Maybe I could ask if I can ha ve them with her said Ron eagerly Great idea said Harry Lavender was waiting beside the portrait hole a complication Harry had not foreseen Youre late WonWon she pouted Ive got you a birthday Leave me alone said Ron impa tiently Harrys going to introduce me to Romilda Vane BIRTHDAY SURPRISES 395 And without another word to her he pushed his way out of the portrait hole Harry tried to make an apologetic face to Lavender but it might have turned out simply amused because she looked more offended than ever as the Fat Lady swung shut behind them Harry had been slightly worried that Slughorn might be at breakfast but he answer ed his office door at the first knock wearing a green velvet dressing gown and matching nightcap and looking rather blearyeyed Harry he mumbled This is ve ry early for a call I generally sleep late on a Saturday Professor Im really sorry to di sturb you said Harry as quietly as possible while Ron stood on ti ptoe attempting to see past Slughorn into his room but my friend Rons swallowed a love potion by mistake You couldnt make him an antidote could you Id take him to Madam Pomfrey but were not supposed to have anything from Weasleys Wizard Wh eezes and you know awkward questions Id have thought you could have whipped him up a remedy Harry an expert potioneer like you asked Slughorn Er said Harry somewhat distra cted by the fact that Ron was now elbowing him in the ribs in an attempt to force his way into the room well Ive never mixed an antidote for a love potion sir and by the time I get it ri ght Ron mightve done something serious Helpfully Ron chose this moment to moan I cant see her Harry is he hiding her Was this potion within date asked Slughorn now eyeing Ron with professional interest The y can strengthen you know the longer theyre kept CHAPTER EIGHTEEN 396 That would explain a lot pa nted Harry now positively wrestling with Ron to keep him fr om knocking Slughorn over Its his birthday Professor he added imploringly Oh all right come in then co me in said Slughorn relenting Ive got the necessary here in my bag its not a difficult antidote Ron burst through the door into Slughorns overheated crowded study tripped over a tasseled footst ool regained his balance by seizing Harry around the neck and mutte red She didnt see that did she Shes not here yet said Har ry watching Slughorn opening his potion kit and adding a few pinches of this and that to a small crystal bottle Thats good said Ron fe rvently How do I look Very handsome said Slughorn smoothly handing Ron a glass of clear liquid Now drink that up its a tonic for the nerves keep you calm when she arrives you know Brilliant said Ron eagerly and he gulped the antidote down noisily Harry and Slughorn watched him For a moment Ron beamed at them Then very slowly his grin sagged and vanished to be replaced by an expressi on of utmost horror Back to normal then said Ha rry grinning Slughorn chuckled Thanks a lot Professor Dont mention it mboy dont mention it said Slughorn as Ron collapsed into a nearby armchair looking devastated Pickmeup thats what he needs Sl ughorn continued now bustling over to a table loaded with drin ks Ive got butterbeer Ive got wine Ive got one last bottle of th is oakmatured mead hmm BIRTHDAY SURPRISES 397 meant to give that to Dumbledore fo r Christmas ah well He shrugged He cant miss what hes never had Why dont we open it now and celebrate Mr Weas leys birthday Nothing like a fine spirit to chase away the pa ngs of disappointed love He chortled again and Harry joi ned in This was the first time he had found himself almost alon e with Slughorn since his disastrous first attempt to extract the true memory from him Perhaps if he could just keep Slughorn in a good mood perhaps if they got through enough of th e oakmatured mead There you are then said Slughorn handing Harry and Ron a glass of mead each before rais ing his own Well a very happy birthday Ralph Ron whispered Harry But Ron who did not appear to be listening to the toast had already thrown the mead into his mouth and swallowed it There was one second hardly more than a heartbeat in which Harry knew there was something terribly wrong and Slughorn it seemed did not and may you have many more Ron Ron had dropped his glass he ha lfrose from his chair and then crumpled his extremities jerking uncontrollably Foam was dribbling from his mouth and his eyes were bulging from their sockets Professor Harry bellowed Do something But Slughorn seemed paralyzed by shock Ron twitched and choked His skin was turning blue What but spluttered Slughorn Harry leapt over a low table an d sprinted toward Slughorns open potion kit pulling out jars and pouches while the terrible CHAPTER EIGHTEEN 398 sound of Rons gargling breath fi lled the room Then he found it the shriveled kidneylike stone Sl ughorn had taken from him in Potions He hurtled back to Rons side wrenched open his jaw and thrust the bezoar into his mouth Ron gave a great shudder a rattling gasp and his body became limp and still N I N E T E E N 399 ELF TAILS o all in all not one of Rons better birthdays said Fred It was evening the hospital wing was quiet the windows curtained the lamps lit Rons wa s the only occupied bed Harry Hermione and Ginny were sitting around him they had spent all day waiting outside the double doors trying to see inside whenever somebody went in or out Madam Pomfrey had only let them enter at eight oclock Fred and George had arrive d at ten past This isnt how we imagined ha nding over our present said George grimly putting down a large wrapped gift on Rons bedside cabinet and sittin g beside Ginny Yeah when we pictured the scene he was conscious said Fred There we were in Hogsmeade wa iting to surprise him said George You were in Hogsmeade asked Ginny looking up We were thinking of buying Zo nkos said Fred gloomily A Hogsmeade branch you know but a fat lot of good itll do us if S CHAPTER NINETEEN 400 you lot arent allowed out at weekends to buy our stuff anymore But never mind that now He drew up a chair beside Harry and looked at Rons pale face How exactly did it happen Harry Harry retold the story he had alre ady recounted it felt like a hundred times to Dumbledore to McGonagall to Madam Pomfrey to Hermione and to Ginny and then I got the bezoar down his throat and his breathing eased up a bit Slughorn ran for help McGonagall and Madam Pomfrey turned up and they brought Ron up here They reckon hell be all right Madam Pomfrey says hell have to stay here a week or so keep taking essence of rue Blimey it was lucky you thought of a bezoar said George in a low voice Lucky there was one in the room said Harry who kept turning cold at the thought of what would have happened if he had not been able to lay hand s on the little stone Hermione gave an almost inaudi ble sniff She had been exceptionally quiet all day Having hurtled whitefaced up to Harry outside the hospital wing and de manded to know what had happened she had taken almost no part in Harry and Ginnys obsessive discussion about how Ron had been poisoned but merely stood beside them clenchjawed an d frightenedlooking until at last they had been al lowed in to see him Do Mum and Dad know Fred asked Ginny Theyve already seen him they arrived an hour ago theyre in Dumbledores office now but theyll be back soon There was a pause while they all watched Ron mumble a little in his sleep ELF TAILS 401 So the poison was in the dr ink said Fred quietly Yes said Harry at on ce he could think of nothing else and was glad for the opportunit y to start discussing it again Slughorn poured it out Would he have been able to slip something into Rons glass without you seeing Probably said Harry but wh y would Slughorn want to poison Ron No idea said Fred frowning You dont think he could have mixed up the glasses by mistake Meaning to get you Why would Slughorn want to poison Harry asked Ginny I dunno said Fred but there must be loads of people whod like to poison Harry mustnt there The Chosen One and all that So you think Slughorns a Death Eater said Ginny Anythings possible said Fred darkly He could be under the Imperius Curse said George Or he could be innocent said Ginny The poison could have been in the bottle in which case it was probably meant for Slughorn himself Whod want to kill Slughorn Dumbledore reckons Voldemort wa nted Slughorn on his side said Harry Slughorn was in hiding for a year before he came to Hogwarts And He though t of the memory Dumbledore had not yet been able to extract from Slughorn And maybe Voldemort wants him out of the way maybe he thinks he could be valuable to Dumbledore But you said Slughorn had been pl anning to give that bottle to Dumbledore for Christmas Ginny reminded him So the poisoner could just as easily ha ve been after Dumbledore CHAPTER NINETEEN 402 Then the poisoner didnt know Slughorn very well said Hermione speaking for the first time in hours and sounding as though she had a bad head cold Anyone who knew Slughorn would have known there was a good chance hed keep something that tasty for himself Ermynee croaked Ron unexpe ctedly from between them They all fell silent watching him anxiously but after muttering incomprehensibly for a moment he merely started snoring The dormitory doors flew open ma king them all jump Hagrid came striding toward them his hair rainflecked his bearskin coat flapping behind him a crossbow in his hand leaving a trail of muddy dolphinsized footpr ints all over the floor Bin in the forest all day he panted Aragogs worse I bin readin to him didn get up ter dinner till jus now an then Professor Sprout told me abou Ron How is he Not bad said Harry T hey say hell be okay No more than six visitors at a time said Madam Pomfrey hurrying out of her office Hagrid makes six Ge orge pointed out Oh yes said Madam Pomfrey who seemed to have been counting Hagrid as several people due to his vastness To cover her confusion she hurried o ff to clear up his muddy footprints with her wand I don believe this said Hagr id hoarsely shaking his great shaggy head as he stared down at Ron Jus don believe it Look at him lyin there Whod want ter hurt him eh Thats just what we were discussing said Harry We dont know ELF TAILS 403 Someone couldn have a grudge against the Gryffindor Quidditch team could they said Hagr id anxiously Firs Katie now Ron I cant see anyone trying to bu mp off a Quidditch team said George Wood mightve done the Slytherins if he couldve got away with it said Fred fairly Well I dont think its Quiddi tch but I think theres a connection between the attacks said Hermione quietly How dyou work that out asked Fred Well for one thing they both ought to have been fatal and werent although that was pure luck And for another neither the poison nor the necklace seems to have reache d the person who was supposed to be killed Of cour se she added broodingly that makes the person behind this even more dangerous in a way because they dont seem to care ho w many people they finish off before they actually reach their victim Before anybody could respond to this ominous pronouncement the dormitory doors opened again and Mr and Mrs Weasley hurried up the ward They had done no more than satisfy themselves that Ron would make a full recovery on their last visit to the ward now Mrs Weasley seized hold of Harry and hugged him very tightly Dumbledores told us how you saved him with the bezoar she sobbed Oh Harry wh at can we say You saved Ginny you saved Arthur now youve saved Ron Dont be I didnt muttered Harry awkwardly Half our family does seem to owe you their lives now I stop and think about it Mr Weasley said in a constr icted voice Well CHAPTER NINETEEN 404 all I can say is that it was a lucky day for the Weasleys when Ron decided to sit in your compartm ent on the Hogwarts Express Harry Harry could not think of any repl y to this and was almost glad when Madam Pomfrey reminded them that there were only supposed to be six visitors around Ro ns bed he and Hermione rose at once to leave and Hagrid decide d to go with them leaving Ron with his family Its terrible growled Hagrid into his beard as the three of them walked back along the corridor to the marble staircase All this new security an kids are st ill gettin hurt Dumbledores worried sick He don sa y much but I can tell Hasnt he got any idea s Hagrid asked Hermione desperately I spect hes got hundreds of ideas brain like his said Hagrid But he doesn know who sent that necklace nor put poison in that wine or theydve bin caught wo uldn they Wha worries me said Hagrid lowering his voice and glancing over his shoulder Harry for good measure checked the ceiling for Peeves is how long Hogwarts can stay open if ki ds are bein attacked Chamber o Secrets all over again isn it Ther ell be panic more parents takin their kids outta school an nex thing yeh know the board o governors Hagrid stopped talking as the ghost of a longhaired woman drifted serenely past then resumed in a hoarse whisper the board o governorsll be talkin about shuttin us up fer good Surely not said Hermione looking worried Gotta see it from their point o view said Hagrid heavily I mean its always bin a bit of a ri sk sendin a kid ter Hogwarts hasn it Yer expect accidents don ye h with hundreds of underage ELF TAILS 405 wizards all locked up tergethe r but attempted murder thas diffrent Sno wonder Dumb ledores angry with Sn Hagrid stopped in his tracks a familiar guilty expression on what was visible of his face above his ta ngled black beard What said Harry qu ickly Dumbledores angry with Snape I never said tha said Hagrid though his look of panic could not have been a bigger giveaway L ook at the time its gettin on fer midnight I need ter Hagrid why is Dumbledore an gry with Snape Harry asked loudly Shhhh said Hagrid looking both nervous and angry Don shout stuff like that Harry dyeh wan me ter lose me job Mind I don suppose yehd care would ye h not now yehve given up Care of Mag Dont try and make me feel guil ty it wont work said Harry forcefully Whats Snape done I dunno Harry I shouldnta hear d it at all I well I was comin outta the forest the other evenin an I overheard em talking well arguin Didnt like te r draw attention to meself so I sorta skulked an tried not ter list en but it was a well a heated discussion an it wasn easy ter block it out Well Harry urged him as Hagr id shuffled his enormous feet uneasily Well I jus heard Snape sayin Dumbledore took too much fer granted an maybe he Snape didn wan ter do it anymore Do what I dunno Harry it sounded like Snape was feelin a bit overworked thas all anyway Dumbledore told him flat out hed CHAPTER NINETEEN 406 agreed ter do it an that was all ther e was to it Pretty firm with him An then he said summat abou Sn ape makin investigations in his House in Slytherin Well there s nothin strange abou that Hagrid added hastily as Harry and He rmione exchanged looks full of meaning All the Heads o Houses were asked ter look inter that necklace business Yeah but Dumbledores not having rows with the rest of them is he said Harry Look Hagrid twisted his crossbow uncomfortably in his hands there was a loud splintering sound and it snapped in two I know what yehre like abou Snap e Harry an I don want yeh ter go readin more inter this than there is Look out said He rmione tersely They turned just in time to se e the shadow of Argus Filch looming over the wall behind them be fore the man himself turned the corner hunchbacked his jowls aquiver Oho he wheezed Out of bed so late thisll me an detention No it won Filch said Hagrid shortly Theyre with me aren they And what difference does that make asked Filch obnoxiously Im a ruddy teacher aren I yeh sneakin Squib said Hagrid firing up at once There was a nasty hissing noise as Filch swelled with fury Mrs Norris had arrived unseen and was twisting herself sinuously around Filchs skinny ankles Get goin said Hagrid out of the corner of his mouth Harry did not need telling twice he and Hermione both hurried off Hagrids and Filchs raised voic es echoed behind them as they ELF TAILS 407 ran They passed Peeves near the turning into Gryffindor Tower but he was streaking happily toward the source of the yelling cackling and calling When theres strife and when theres trouble Call on Peevsie hell make double The Fat Lady was snoozing and not pleased to be woken but swung forward grumpily to allow them to clamber into the mercifully peaceful and empty common room It did not seem that people knew about Ron yet Harry wa s very relieved He had been interrogated enough that day He rmione bade him good night and set off for the girls dormitory Harry however remained behind taking a seat beside the fire and looking down into the dying embers So Dumbledore had argued with Sn ape In spite of all he had told Harry in spite of his insist ence that he trusted Snape completely he had lost his temper with him He did not think that Snape had tried hard enough to in vestigate the Slytherins or perhaps to investigate a single Slytherin Malfoy Was it because Dumbledore did not want Harry to do anything foolish to take matters into his own hands that he had pretended there was nothing in Harrys suspic ions That seemed likely It might even be that Dumbledore did not want anything to distract Harry from their lessons or from procuring that memory from Slughorn Perhaps Dumbledore did not think it right to confide suspicions about his staff to sixteenyearolds There you are Potter CHAPTER NINETEEN 408 Harry jumped to his feet in shock his wand at the ready He had been quite convinced that the common room was empty he had not been at all prepared for a hulking figure to rise suddenly out of a distant chair A closer look showed him that it was Cormac McLaggen Ive been waiting for you to come back said McLaggen disregarding Harrys drawn wand Must ve fallen asleep Look I saw them taking Weasley up to the hosp ital wing earlie r Didnt look like hell be fit for next weeks match It took Harry a few moments to realize what McLaggen was talking about Oh right Quidditch he said putting his wand back into the belt of his jeans and ru nning a hand wearily through his hair Yeah he might not make it Well then Ill be playing Keeper won t I said McLaggen Yeah said Harry Yea h I suppose so He could not think of an argu ment against it after all McLaggen had certainly performe d secondbest in the trials Excellent said McLaggen in a satisfied voice So whens practice What Oh theres one tomorrow evening Good Listen Potter we should ha ve a talk beforehand Ive got some ideas on strategy you might find useful Right said Harry unenthusiasticall y Well Ill hear them tomorrow then Im pretty tire d now see you The news that Ron had been poiso ned spread quickly next day but it did not cause the sensation that Katies attack had done People seemed to think that it might have been an acci dent given that he had been in the Poti ons masters room at the time and that as ELF TAILS 409 he had been given an antidote imme diately there was no real harm done In fact the Gryffindors were generally much more interested in the upcoming Quidditch match against Hufflepuff for many of them wanted to see Zacharias Sm ith who played Chaser on the Hufflepuff team punished soundly for his commentary during the opening match against Slytherin Harry however had never been le ss interested in Quidditch he was rapidly becoming obsessed with Draco Malfoy Still checking the Marauders Map whenever he got a chance he sometimes made detours to wherever Malfoy happened to be but had not yet detected him doing anything out of the ordinary And still there were those inexplicable times when Malfoy simply vanished from the map But Harry did not get a lot of ti me to consider the problem what with Quidditch practice home work and the fact that he was now being dogged wherever he went by Cormac McLaggen and Lavender Brown He could not decide which of them was more annoying McLaggen kept up a constant stream of hints that he would make a better permanent Keeper for th e team than Ron and that now t h a t H a r r y w a s s e e i n g h i m p l a y regularly he would surely come around to this way of thinking too he was also keen to criticize the other players and provide Harry with detailed training schemes so that more than once Harry was forced to remind him who was Captain Meanwhile Lavender kept sidlin g up to Harry to discuss Ron which Harry found almost more wearing than McLaggens Quidditch lectures At first Lavend er had been very annoyed that nobody had thought to tell her that Ron was in the hospital CHAPTER NINETEEN 410 wing I mean I am his girlfriend but unfortunately she had now decided to forgive Harry this lapse of memory and was keen to have lots of indepth chats with him about Rons feelings a most uncomfortable experience that Harry would have happily forgone Look why dont you talk to Ron about all this Harry asked after a particularly long interrogation from Lavender that took in everything from precisely what Ro n had said about her new dress robes to whether or not Harry thought that Ron considered his relationship with Lavender to be serious Well I would but hes always asleep when I go and see him said Lavender fretfully Is he said Harry surprised for he had found Ron perfectly alert every time he had been up to the hospital wing both highly interested in the news of Dumble dore and Snapes row and keen to abuse McLaggen as much as possible Is Hermione Granger still visiti ng him Lavender demanded suddenly Yeah I think so Well theyre friends arent they said Harry uncomfortably Friends dont make me laugh said Lavender scornfully She didnt talk to him for weeks after he started going out with me But I suppose she wants to make up w it h him now h es a ll interesting Would you call getting poisoned being interesting asked Harry Anyway sorry got to go theres McLaggen coming for a talk about Quidditch said Harry hurriedly and he dashed sideways through a door pretending to be solid wall and sprinted ELF TAILS 411 down the shortcut that would take him off to Potions where thankfully neither Lavender nor McLaggen could follow him On the morning of the Quidditch match against Hufflepuff Harry dropped in on the hospital wing before heading down to the pitch Ron was very agitated Ma dam Pomfrey would not let him go down to watch the match feel ing it would overexcite him So hows McLaggen shaping up he asked Harry nervously apparently forgetting that he had already asked the same question twice Ive told you said Harry patiently he could be worldclass and I wouldnt want to keep him He keeps trying to tell everyone what to do he thinks he could pl ay every position better than the rest of us I cant wait to be sh ot of him And spea king of getting shot of people Harry added getting to his feet and picking up his Firebolt will you stop pretendin g to be asleep when Lavender comes to see you Shes driving me mad as well Oh said Ron looking sh eepish Yeah All right If you dont want to go out with her anymore just tell her said Harry Yeah well its not that easy is it said Ron He paused Hermione going to look in before the match he added casually No shes already gone down to the pi tch with Ginny Oh said Ron looking rather glum Right Well good luck Hope you hammer McLa g I mean Smith Ill try said Harry shoulder ing his broom See you after the match He hurried down through the deserted corridors the whole school was outside either already seated in the stadium or heading CHAPTER NINETEEN 412 down toward it He was looking out of the windows he passed trying to gauge how much wind they were facing when a noise ahead made him glance up and he saw Malfoy walking toward him accompanied by two girls both of whom looked sulky and resentful Malfoy stopped short at the sigh t of Harry then gave a short humorless laugh and continued walking Wherere you going Harry demanded Yeah Im really going to tell you because its your business Potter sneered Malfoy Youd be tter hurry up theyll be waiting for the Chosen Captain the Boy Who Scored whatever they call you these days One of the girls gave an unwilling giggle Ha rry stared at her She blushed Malfoy pushed past Harry and she and her friend followed at a trot turn ing the corner and vanishing from view Harry stood rooted on the spot and watched them disappear This was infuriating he was alre ady cutting it fine to get to the match on time and yet there was Ma lfoy skulking off while the rest of the school was absent Harrys best chance yet of discovering what Malfoy was up to The silent seconds trickled past and Harry remained where he was frozen ga zing at the place where Malfoy had vanished Where have you been demanded Ginny as Harry sprinted into the changing rooms The wh ole team was changed and ready Coote and Peakes the Beaters we re both hitting their clubs nervously against their legs I met Malfoy Harry told her quietly as he pulled his scarlet robes over his head So ELF TAILS 413 So I wanted to know how come hes up at the castle with a couple of girlfriends while everyo ne else is down here Does it matter right now Well Im not likely to find ou t am I said Harry seizing his Firebolt and pushing his glasse s straight Come on then And without another word he marched out onto the pitch to deafening cheers and boos There was little wind the clou ds were patchy every now and then there were dazzling fl ashes of bright sunlight Tricky conditions McLaggen said bracingly to the team Coote Peakes youll wa nt to fly out of the sun so they dont see you coming Im the Captain McLaggen shut up giving them instructions said Harry angrily Just ge t up by the goal posts Once McLaggen had marched off Harry turned to Coote and Peakes Make sure you do fly out of the sun he told them grudgingly He shook hands with the Huff lepuff Captain and then on Madam Hoochs whistle kicked o ff and rose into the air higher than the rest of his team streaking around the pitch in search of the Snitch If he could catch it good an d early there might be a chance he could get back up to the cas tle seize the Marauders Map and find out what Malf oy was doing And thats Smith of Hufflepuff wi th the Quaffle said a dreamy voice echoing over the ground s He did the commentary last time of course and Ginny Weasley flew into him I think probably on purpose it looked like it Smith was being quite rude about Gryffindor I expect he regrets that now hes playing them oh CHAPTER NINETEEN 414 look hes lost the Quaffle Ginny took it from him I do like her shes very nice Harry stared down at the comm entators podium Surely nobody in their right mind would have let Luna Lovegood commentate But even from above there was no mistaking that long dirtyblonde hair nor the necklace of butterbeer corks Beside Luna Professor McGonagall was lo oking slightly uncomfortable as though she was indeed having second thoughts about this appointment but now that big Hufflepuf f players got the Quaffle from her I cant remember his name it s something like Bibble no Buggins Its Cadwallader said Professo r McGonagall loudly from beside Luna The crowd laughed Harry stared around for the Snitch there was no sign of it Moments later Cadwallader scor ed McLaggen had been shouting criticism at Ginny for allowing the Quaffle out of her possession with the result that he had not noticed the large red ball soaring past his right ear McLaggen will you pay attentio n to what youre supposed to be doing and leave everyone else alone bellowed Harry wheeling around to face his Keeper Youre not setting a great example McLaggen shouted back redfaced and furious And Harry Potters now having an argument with his Keeper said Luna serenely while both Hu fflepuffs and Slytherins below in the crowd cheered and jeered I don t think thatll help him find the Snitch but maybe its a clever ruse ELF TAILS 415 Swearing angrily Harry spun ro und and set off around the pitch again scanning the skies for some sign of the tiny winged golden ball Ginny and Demelza scored a goal apiece giving the redandgoldclad supporters below somet hing to cheer about Then Cadwallader scored again making thin gs level but Luna did not seem to have noticed she appeared sing ularly uninterested in such mundane things as the score and kept attempting to draw the crowds attention to such things as intere stingly shaped clouds and the possibility that Zacharias Smith wh o had so far failed to maintain possession of the Quaffle for longer than a minute was suffering from something called Losers Lurgy Seventyforty to Hu fflepuff barked Professor McGonagall into Lunas megaphone Is it already said Luna vagu ely Oh look The Gryffindor Keepers got hold of one of the Beaters bats Harry spun around in midair Sure enough McLa ggen for reasons best known to himself had pulled Peakess bat from him and appeared to be demonstrating how to hit a Bludger toward an oncoming Cadwallader Will you give him back his bat an d get back to the goal posts roared Harry pelting toward Mc Laggen just as McLaggen took a ferocious swipe at the Bludger and mishit it A blinding sickening pain a flash of light distant screams and the se nsation of falling down a long tunnel And the next thing Harry knew he was lying in a remarkably warm and comfortable bed and l ooking up at a lamp that was throwing a circle of go lden light onto a shadowy ceiling He raised CHAPTER NINETEEN 416 his head awkwardly There on his left was a familiarlooking freckly redhaired person Nice of you to drop in said Ron grinning Harry blinked and looked around Of course He was in the hospital wing The sky outside was indi go streaked with crimson The match must have finished hours ago as had any hope of cornering Malfoy Harrys head felt stra ngely heavy he raised a hand and felt a stiff turban of bandages What happened Cracked skull said Madam Pomf rey bustling up and pushing him back against his pillows Not hing to worry about I mended it at once but Im keeping you in overnight You shouldnt overexert yourself for a few hours I dont want to stay here over night said Harry angrily sitting up and throwing back his covers I want to find McLaggen and kill him Im afraid that wo uld come under the heading of overexertion said Madam Pomfrey pushin g him firmly back onto the bed and raising her wand in a threatening manner You will stay here until I discharge you Potter or I shall call the headmaster She bustled back into her office and Harry sank back into his pillows fuming D y o u k n o w h o w m u c h w e l o s t b y h e a s k e d R o n t h r o u g h clenched teeth Well yeah I do said Ron apologetically Final score was three hundred and twen ty to sixty Brilliant said Harry savagely Really brilliant When I get hold of McLaggen You dont want to get hold of him hes the size of a troll said ELF TAILS 417 Ron reasonably Personally I think theres a lot to be said for hexing him with that toenail thing of the Princes Anyway the rest of the team mightve dealt with him before you get out of here theyre not happy There was a note of badly suppressed glee in Rons voice Harry could tell he was nothing short of thrilled that McLaggen had messed up so badly Harry lay there staring up at the patch of light on the ceiling his recently mended skull not hurting precisely but feeling slightly tender unde rneath all the bandaging I could hear the match commentary from here said Ron his voice now shaking with laughter I ho pe Luna alw ays co mmentates from now on Losers Lurgy But Harry was still too angry to see much humor in the situation and after a while Rons snorts subsided Ginny came in to visit while you were unconscious he said after a long pause and Harrys imag ination zoomed into overdrive rapidly constructing a scene in whic h Ginny weeping over his lifeless form confessed her feelings of deep attraction to him while Ron gave them his blessing S he reckons you only just arrived on time for the match How come You left here early enough Oh said Harry as the sc ene in his minds eye imploded Yeah well I saw Malfoy snea king off with a couple of girls who didnt look like they wanted to be with him and thats the second time hes made sure he isnt down on the Qui dditch pitch with the rest of the school he skippe d the last match too remember Harry sighed Wish Id followed him now the match was such a fiasco Dont be stupid said Ron sharply You couldnt have missed a Quidditch match just to follow Malfoy youre the Captain CHAPTER NINETEEN 418 I want to know what hes up to said Harry And dont tell me its all in my head not after what I overheard between him and Snape I never said it was all in your head said Ron hoisting himself up on an elbow in turn and frowni ng at Harry but theres no rule s a y i n g o n l y o n e p e r s o n a t a t i m e c a n b e p l o t t i n g a n y t h i n g i n t h i s place Youre gettin g a bit obsessed with Malfoy Harry I mean thinking about missing a match just to follow him I want to catch him at it sa id Harry in frustration I mean wheres he going when he disappears off the map I dunno Hogsmeade suggested Ron yawning Ive never seen him going along any of the secret passageways on the map I though t they were being watched now anyway Well then I dunno said Ron Silence fell between them Harry stared up at the circle of lamplight above him thinking If only he had Rufus Scrimgeour s power he would have been able to set a tail upon Malfoy but unfortunately Harry did not have an office full of Aurors at his command He thought fleetingly of trying to set something up with the DA but there again was the problem that people would be missed from lessons most of them after all still ha d full schedules There was a low rumbling snore from Rons bed After a while Madam Pomfrey came out of her office this time wearing a thick dressing gown It was easiest to fe ign sleep Harry rolled over onto his side and listened to all the cu rtains closing themselves as she waved her wand The lamps dimmed and she returned to her office he heard the door click behind her and knew that she was off to bed ELF TAILS 419 This was Harry reflected in the da rkness the third time that he had been brought to the hospital wing because of a Quidditch injury Last time he had fallen o ff his broom due to the presence of dementors around the pitch and th e time before that all the bones had been removed from his arm by the incurably inept Professor Lockhart That ha d been his most painful injury by far he remembered the agony of regrowin g an armful of bones in one night a discomfort not eased by the arrival of an unexpected visitor in the middle of the Harry sat bolt upright his heart pounding his bandage turban askew He had the solution at last There was a way to have Malfoy followed how could he have forgo tten why hadnt he thought of it before But the question was how to call him What did you do Quietly tentatively Har ry spoke into the darkness Kreacher There was a very loud crack and the sounds of scuffling and squeaks filled the silent r oom Ron awoke with a yelp Whats going Harry pointed his wand hastily at the door of Madam Pomfreys office and muttered Muffliato so that she would not come running Then he scrambled to the end of his bed for a better look at what was going on Two houseelves were rolling around on the floor in the middle of the dormitory one wearing a shrunken maroon jumper and several woolly hats the other a filthy old rag strung over his hips like a loincloth Then there was another loud bang and Peeves the Poltergeist appeared in midair above the wrestling elves CHAPTER NINETEEN 420 I was watching that Potty he told Harry indignantly pointing at the fight below before lett ing out a loud cackle Look at the ickle creatures squabbling bite y bitey punchy punchy Kreacher will not insult Harry Potter in front of Dobby no he wont or Dobby will shut Kreach ers mouth for him cried Dobby in a highpitched voice kicky scratchy cried Peeves happily now pelting bits of chalk at the elves to enrage them further Tweaky pokey Kreacher will say what he likes about his master oh yes and what a master he is filthy fri end of Mudbloods oh what would poor Kreachers mistress say Exactly what Kreachers mistress would have said they did not find out for at that moment Dobby sank his knobbly little fist into Kreachers mouth and knocked out half of his teeth Harry and Ron both leapt out of their beds and wrenched the two elves apart though they continue d to try and kick an d punch each other egged on by Peeves who swooped around the lamp squealing Stick your fingers up his nosey draw his cork and pull his earsies Harry aimed his wand at Peeves and said Langlock Peeves clutched at his throat gulped then swooped from the room making obscene gestures but unable to speak owing to the fact that his tongue had just glued itself to the roof of his mouth Nice one said Ron appreciatively lifting Dobby into the air so that his flailing limbs no longer made contact with Kreacher That was another Prince hex wasnt it Yeah said Harry twisting Kreachers wizened arm into a half nelson Right Im forbidding yo u to fight each other Well ELF TAILS 421 Kreacher youre forbidden to fight Dobby Dobby I know Im not allowed to give you orders Dobby is a free houseelf and he can obey anyone he likes and Dobby will do whatever Harry Po tter wants him to do said Dobby tears now streamin g down his shriveled li ttle face onto his jumper Okay then said Harry and he and Ron both released the elves who fell to the floor but did not continue fighting Master called me croaked Krea cher sinking into a bow even as he gave Harry a look that pl ainly wished him a painful death Yeah I did said Harry glan cing toward Madam Pomfreys office door to check that the Muffliato spell was still working there was no sign that she had heard any of the commotion Ive got a job for you Kreacher will do whatever Master wants said Kreacher sinking so low that his lips almost touched his gnarled toes because Kreacher has no choice but Kreach er is ashamed to have such a master yes Dobby will do it Harry Potter squeaked Dobby his tennisballsized eyes still swimming in te ars Dobby would be honored to help Harry Potter Come to think of it it would be good to have both of you said Harry Okay then I wa nt you to tail Draco Malfoy Ignoring the look of mingled surp rise and exasperation on Rons face Harry went on I want to know where hes going who hes meeting and what hes doing I wa nt you to follow him around the clock Yes Harry Potter said Dobby at once his great eyes shining CHAPTER NINETEEN 422 with excitement And if Dobby does it wrong Dobby will throw himself off the topmost tower Harry Potter There wont be any need for that sa id Harry hastily Master wants me to follow th e youngest of the Malfoys croaked Kreacher Master wants me to spy upon the pureblood greatnephew of my old mistress Thats the one said Harry fore seeing a great danger and determining to prevent it immediatel y And youre forbidden to tip him off Kreacher or to show him what youre up to or to talk to him at all or to write him messages or or to contact him in any way Got it He thought he could see Kreacher struggling to see a loophole in the instructions he had just been given and waited After a moment or two and to Harrys great sati sfaction Kreacher bowed deeply again and said with bitter resentment Master thinks of everything and Kreacher must obey him even though Kreacher would much rather be the servant of the Malfoy boy oh yes Thats settled then said Harry Ill want regular reports but make sure Im not surrounded by people when you turn up Ron and Hermione are okay And dont tell anyone what youre doing Just stick to Malfoy like a couple of wart plasters T W E N T Y 423 LORD VOLDEMORTS REQUEST arry and Ron left the hospital wing first thing on Monday morning restored to full health by the ministrations of Madam Pomfrey and now able to enjoy the benefits of having been knocked out and poiso ned the best of which was that Hermione was friends with Ron again Hermione even escorted them down to breakfast bringing with her the news that Ginny had argued with Dean The drowsing creature in Harrys chest suddenly raised its head snif fing the air hopefully What did they row about he aske d trying to sound casual as they turned onto a se venthfloor corridor that was deserted but for a very small girl who had been examining a tapestry of trolls in tutus She looked terrified at the sight of the approaching sixth years and dropped the heavy brass scales she was carrying Its all right said Hermione ki ndly hurrying forward to help her Here H CHAPTER TWENTY 424 She tapped the broken scales with her wand and said Reparo The girl did not say thank you bu t remained rooted to the spot as they passed and watched them out of sight Ron glanced back at her I swear theyre gettin g smaller he said Never mind her said Harry a little impatiently What did Ginny and Dean row about Hermione Oh Dean was laughing about McLaggen hitting that Bludger at you said Hermione It mustve looked funny said Ron reasonably It didnt look funny at all sa id Hermione hotly It looked terrible and if Coote and Peakes ha dnt caught Harry he could have been very badly hurt Yeah well there was no need for Ginny and Dean to split up over it said Harry still trying to sound casual Or are they still together Yes they are but why are you so interested asked Hermione giving Harry a sharp look I just dont want my Quidditch team messed up again he said hastily but Hermione continued to look suspicious and he was most relieved when a voice behind them called Harry giving him an excuse to turn his back on her Oh hi Luna I went to the hospit al wing to find you said Luna rummaging in her bag But they said youd left She thrust what appeared to be a green onion a large spotted toadstool and a considerable amount of what looked like cat litter into Rons hands finally pulling ou t a rather grubby scroll of parchment that she handed to Harry LORD VOLDEMORTS REQUEST 425 Ive been told to give you this It was a small roll of parchment which Harry recognized at once as another invitation to a lesson with Dumbledore Tonight he told Ron and Herm ione once he had unrolled it Nice commentary last match said Ron to Luna as she took back the green onion the toadstool and the cat litter Luna smiled vaguely Youre making fun of me arent you she said Everyone says I was dreadful No Im serious said Ron ear nestly I cant remember enjoying commentary more What is this by the way he added holding the onionlike object up to eye level Oh its a Gurdyroot she said stuffing the cat litter and the toadstool back into her bag You can keep it if you li ke Ive got a few of them Theyre really excellent for warding off Gulping Plimpies And she walked away leaving Ron chortling still clutching the Gurdyroot You know shes grown on me Luna he said as they set off again for the Great Hall I know sh es insane but its in a good He stopped talking very sudden ly Lavender Brown was standing at the foot of the marble staircase looking thunderous Hi said Ron nervously Cmon Harry muttered to Hermione and they sped past though not before they had heard Lavender say Why didnt you tell me you were getting out today And why was she with you Ron looked both sulky and anno yed when he appeared at breakfast half an hour later and thou gh he sat with Lavender Harry did not see them exchange a word all the time they were together Hermione was acting as though she wa s quite oblivious to all of this CHAPTER TWENTY 426 but once or twice Harry saw an inex plicable smirk cross her face All that day she seemed to be in a particularly good mood and that evening in the common room she even consented to look over in other words finish writing Ha rrys Herbology essay something she had been resolutely refusing to do up to this point because she had known that Harry would th en let Ron copy his work Thanks a lot Hermione said Harry giving her a hasty pat on the back as he checked his watch and saw that it was nearly eight oclock Listen Ive got to hurry or Ill be late for Dumbledore She did not answer but merely crossed out a few of his feebler sentences in a weary sort of wa y Grinning Harry hurried out through the portrait hole and off to the headmasters office The gargoyle leapt aside at the mention of toffee clairs and Harry took the spiral staircase two steps at a ti me knocking on the door just as a clock within chimed eight Enter called Dumbledore bu t as Harry put out a hand to push the door it was wrenched op en from inside There stood Professor Trelawney Aha she cried pointing dram atically at Harry as she blinked at him through her magnifying spec tacles So this is the reason I am to be thrown unceremoniously from your office Dumbledore My dear Sybill said Dumbledore in a slightly exasperated voice there is no question of throwing you unceremoniously from anywhere but Harry does have an appointment and I really dont think there is any more to be said Very well said Professor Trelawney in a deeply wounded voice If you will not banish the usurping nag so be it LORD VOLDEMORTS REQUEST 427 Perhaps I shall find a school wher e my talents are better appreciated She pushed past Harry and disa ppeared down the spiral staircase they heard her stumble halfway down and Harry guessed that she had tripped over one of her trailing shawls Please close the door and sit down Harry said Dumbledore sounding rather tired Harry obeyed noticing as he took his usual seat in front of Dumbledores desk that the Pensie ve lay between them once more as did two more tiny crystal bo ttles full of swirling memory Professor Trelawney still isnt ha ppy Firenze is teaching then Harry asked No said Dumbledore Divination is turning out to be much more trouble than I could have fo reseen never having studied the subject myself I cannot ask Firenz e to return to the forest where he is now an outcast nor can I as k Sybill Trelawney to leave Between ourselves she has no idea of the danger she would be in outside the castle She does not kn ow and I think it would be unwise to enlighten her that she made the prophecy about you and Voldemort you see Dumbledore heaved a deep sigh then said But never mind my staffing problems We have much more important matters to discuss Firstly have you managed th e task I set you at the end of our previous lesson Ah said Harry brought up sh ort What with Apparition lessons and Quidditch and Ron bein g poisoned and getting his skull cracked and his determination to find out what Draco Malfoy was up to Harry had almost forgo tten about the memory Dumbledore CHAPTER TWENTY 428 had asked him to extract from Pr ofessor Slughorn Well I asked P r o f e s s o r S l u g h o r n a b o u t i t a t t h e e n d o f P o t i o n s s i r b u t e r h e wouldnt give it to me There was a little silence I see said Dumbledore eventually peering at Harry over the top of his halfmoon spectacles and giving Harry the usual sensation that he was being Xrayed A nd you feel that you have exerted your very best efforts in this ma tter do you That you have exercised all of your considerable ingenuity That you have left no depth of cunning unplumbed in your quest to retrieve the memory Well Harry stalled at a loss for what to say next His single attempt to get hold of the memory suddenly seemed embarrassingly feeble Well the day Ron swa llowed love potion by mistake I took him to Professor Slughorn I thought maybe if I got Professor Slughorn in a good enough mood And did that work asked Dumbledore Well no sir becaus e Ron got poisoned which naturally made you forg et all about trying to retrieve the memory I would have expected nothing else while your best friend was in danger Once it be came clear that Mr Weasley was going to make a full recovery ho wever I would have hoped that you returned to the task I set you I thought I made it clear to you how very important that memory is Indeed I did my best to impress upon you that it is the most crucial memory of all and that we will be wasting our time without it A hot prickly feeling of shame spread from the top of Harrys head all the way down his body Dumbledore had not raised his voice he did not even sound an gry but Harry would have preferred him to yell this cold disappoin tment was worse than anything LORD VOLDEMORTS REQUEST 429 Sir he said a little desperately it isnt that I wasnt bothered or anything Ive just had other other things O t h e r t h i n g s o n y o u r m i n d Dumbledore finished the sentence for him I see Silence fell between them again the most uncomfortable silence Harry had ever experienced with Du mbledore it seemed to go on and on punctuated only by the li ttle grunting snor es of the portrait of Armando Dippet over Dumbledores head Harry felt strangely diminished as though he had shrunk a little since he had entered the room When he could st and it no longer he said Professor Dumbledore Im really sorry I should have done more I should have realized you wouldnt have asked me to do it if it wasnt really important Thank you for saying that Ha rry said Dumbledore quietly May I hope then that you will give this matter higher priority from now on There will be little point in our meeting after tonight unless we have that memory Ill do it sir Ill get it fr om him he said earnestly Then we shall say no more abou t it just now said Dumbledore more kindly but continue with our story where we left off You remember where that was Yes sir said Harry quickly V oldemort killed his father and his grandparents and made it look as though his Uncle Morfin did it Then he went back to Hogwarts and he asked he asked Professor Slughorn about Horcruxes he mumbled shamefacedly Very good said Dumbledore Now you will remember I hope that I told you at the very outset of these meetings of ours that we would be entering the realms of guesswork and speculation Yes sir CHAPTER TWENTY 430 Thus far as I hope you agree I have shown you reasonably firm sources of fact for my deductions as to what Voldemort did until the age of seventeen Harry nodded But now Harry said Dumble dore now things become murkier and stranger If it was di fficult to find evidence about the boy Riddle it has been almost im possible to find anyone prepared to reminisce about the man Voldem ort In fact I doubt whether there is a soul alive apart from hi mself who could give us a full account of his life since he left Hogwarts However I have two last memories that I would like to share with you Dumbledore indicated the two little crystal bottles gleaming beside the Pensieve I shall then be glad of your opinio n as to whether the conclusions I have drawn from them seem likely The idea that Dumbledore valued his opinion this highly made Harry feel even more deeply ashamed that he had failed in the task of retrieving the Horc rux memory and he shifted guiltily in his seat as Dumbledore raised the firs t of the two bottles to the light and examined it I hope you are not tired of divi ng into other peoples memories for they are curious recollections these two he said This first one came from a very old houseel f by the name of Hokey Before we see what Hokey witnessed I must quickly recount how Lord Voldemort left Hogwarts He reached the seventh year of his schooling with as you might have expected top grades in ever y examination he had taken All around him his classmates were deciding which jobs they were to pursue once they had left Hogwarts Nearly everybody expected spectacular things from Tom Riddle prefect Head Boy winner of LORD VOLDEMORTS REQUEST 431 the Award for Special Services to the School I know that several teachers Professor Slughorn amongs t them suggested that he join the Ministry of Magic offered to set up appointments put him in touch with useful contacts He refu sed all offers The next thing the staff knew Voldemort was working at Borgin and Burkes At Borgin and Burkes Harry repeated stunned At Borgin and Burkes repeat ed Dumbledore calmly I think you will see what attractions the place held for him when we have entered Hokeys memory But this was not Voldemorts first choice of job Hardly anyone knew of it at the time I was one of the few in whom the then headmaster confided but Voldemort first approached Professor Dippet and asked whether he could remain at Hogwarts as a teacher He wanted to stay here Why asked Harry more amazed still I believe he had several reason s though he confided none of them to Professor Dippet said Dumbledore Firstly and very importantly Voldemort was I believ e more attached to this school than he has ever been to a person Hogwarts was where he had been happiest the first and only place he had felt at home Harry felt slightly uncomfortable at these words for this was exactly how he felt about Hogwarts too Secondly the castle is a strong hold of ancient magic Undoubtedly Voldemort had penetrated many more of its secrets than most of the students who pass through th e place but he may have felt that there were still mysteries to unravel stores of magic to tap And thirdly as a teacher he would have had great power and influence over young witches and wiza rds Perhaps he had gained the idea from Professor Slughorn th e teacher with whom he was on best terms who had demonstrated how influential a role a teacher CHAPTER TWENTY 432 can play I do not imagine for an instant that Voldemort envisaged spending the rest of his life at Hogwarts but I do think that he saw it as a useful recruiting ground and a place wher e he might begin to build himself an army But he didnt get the job sir No he did not Professor Dipp et told him that he was too young at eighteen but invited him to reapply in a few years if he still wished to teach How did you feel ab out that sir asked Harry hesitantly Deeply uneasy said Dumble dore I had advised Armando against the appointment I did not give the reasons I have given you for Professor Dippet was ve ry fond of Voldemort and convinced of his honesty But I did no t want Lord Voldemort back at this school and especially not in a position of power Which job did he want sir What subject did he want to teach Somehow Harry knew the answ er even before Dumbledore gave it Defense Against the Dark Arts It was being taught at the time by an old Professor by the name of Galatea Merrythought who had been at Hogwarts for nearly fifty years So Voldemort went off to Borgin and Burkes and all the staff who had admired him said what a waste it was a brilliant young wizard like that working in a shop However Voldemort was no mere assistant Polite and handso me and clever he was soon given particular jobs of the type that only exist in a place like Borgin and Burkes which specializes as you know Harry in objects with unusual and powerful properties Vo ldemort was sent to persuade LORD VOLDEMORTS REQUEST 433 people to part with their treasure s for sale by the partners and he was by all accounts unusua lly gifted at doing this Ill bet he was said Harry unable to contain himself Well quite said Dumbledore wi th a faint smile And now it is time to hear from Hokey the houseelf who worked for a very old very rich wi tch by the name of Hepzibah Smith Dumbledore tapped a bottle with his wand the cork flew out and he tipped the swirling memory into the Pensieve saying as he did so After you Harry Harry got to his feet and bent once more over the rippling silver contents of the stone basin until his face touched them He tumbled through dark nothingness an d landed in a sitting room in front of an immensely fat old lady wearing an elaborate ginger wig and a brilliant pink set of robes th at flowed all around her giving her the look of a melting iced cake She was looking into a small jeweled mirror and dabbing rouge onto her alread y scarlet cheeks with a large powder puff while the tiniest and oldest houseelf Harry had ever seen laced her fleshy feet into tight satin slippers Hurry up Hokey said Hepzibah imperiously He said hed come at four its only a couple of minutes to and hes never been late yet She tucked away her powder puff as the houseelf straightened up The top of the elfs head barely reached the seat of Hepzibahs chair and her papery skin hung o ff her frame just like the crisp linen sheet she wore draped like a toga How do I look said Hepzibah turning her head to admire the various angles of her face in the mirror Lovely madam squeaked Hokey CHAPTER TWENTY 434 Harry could only assume that it was down in Hokeys contract that she must lie through her teeth when asked this question because Hepzibah Smith looked a long way from lovely in his opinion A tinkling doorbell rang and both mistress and elf jumped Quick quick hes here Hokey cried Hepzibah and the elf scurried out of the room which was so crammed with objects that it was difficult to see how anybod y could navigate their way across it without knocking over at leas t a dozen things There were cabinets full of little la cquered boxes cases full of goldembossed books shelves of orbs and celest ial globes and many flourishing potted plants in brass containers In fact the room looked like a cross between a magical antiqu e shop and a conservatory The houseelf returned within minu tes followed by a tall young man Harry had no difficulty what soever in recognizing as Voldemort He was plainly dressed in a black suit his ha ir was a little longer than it had been at school and his cheeks were hollowed but all of this suited him he look ed more handsome than ever He picked his way through the cramped room with an air that showed he had visited many times before and bowed low over Hepzibahs fat little hand brushi ng it with his lips I brought you flowers he said quietly producing a bunch of roses from nowhere You naughty boy you shouldnt have squealed old Hepzibah though Harry noticed that she had an empty vase standing ready on the nearest little table You do spoil this old lady Tom Sit down sit down Wher es Hokey Ah The houseelf had come dashing back into the room carrying a tray of little cakes which she set at her mistresss elbow LORD VOLDEMORTS REQUEST 435 Help yourself Tom said Hepzib ah I know how you love my cakes Now how are you You look pale They overwork you at that shop Ive said it a hundred times Voldemort smiled mechanical ly and Hepzibah simpered Well whats your excuse for visi ting this time she asked batting her lashes Mr Burke would like to make an improved offer for the goblinmade armor said Voldemort Five hundred Galleons he feels it is a more than fair Now now not so fast or Ill t hink youre only here for my trinkets pouted Hepzibah I am ordered here because of th em said Voldemort quietly I am only a poor assistant madam who must do as he is told Mr Burke wishes me to inquire Oh Mr Burke phooey said Hepzibah waving a little hand Ive something to show you that Ive never shown Mr Burke Can you keep a secret Tom Will you promise you wont tell Mr Burke Ive got it Hed never let me rest if he knew Id shown it to you and Im not selling not to Burke not to anyone But you Tom youll appreciate it for its history not how many Galleons you can get for it Id be glad to see anything Miss Hepzibah shows me said Voldemort quietly and Hepzibah gave another girlish giggle I had Hokey bring it out for me Hokey where are you I want to show Mr Riddle our finest treasure In fact bring both while youre at it Here madam squeaked the houseelf and Harry saw two leather boxes one on top of the ot her moving across the room as if of their own volition though he knew the tiny elf was holding CHAPTER TWENTY 436 them over her head as she wend ed her way between tables pouffes and footstools Now said Hepzibah happily taking the boxes from the elf laying them in her lap and prepar ing to open the topmost one I think youll like this Tom Oh if my family knew I was showing you They cant wait to get their hands on this She opened the lid Harry edged fo rward a little to get a better view and saw what looked like a small golden cup with two finely wrought handles I wonder whether you know what it is Tom Pick it up have a good look whispered Hepzibah and Voldemort stretched out a longfingered hand and lifted the cu p by one handle out of its snug silken wrappings Harry thought he saw a red gleam in his dark eyes His greedy expression was cu riously mirrored on Hepzibahs face except that her tiny eyes were fixed upon Voldemorts handsome features A badger murmured Voldemort examining the engraving upon the cup Then this was Helga Hufflepuffs as you very well know you clever boy said Hepzibah leaning forward with a loud creaking of corsets and actually pinching his hollow cheek Didnt I tell you I was distantly descended This has been handed dow n in the family for years and years Lovely isnt it And all sort s of powers its supposed to possess too but I havent tested them thoroughly I just keep it nice and safe in here She hooked the cup back off Vold emorts long forefinger and restored it gently to its box too inte nt upon settling it carefully back into position to notice the shadow that crossed Voldemorts face as the cup was taken away LORD VOLDEMORTS REQUEST 437 Now then said Hepzibah happ ily wheres Hokey Oh yes there you are take that away now Hokey The elf obediently took the bo xed cup and Hepzibah turned her attention to the much flatter box in her lap I think youll like this even mo re Tom she whispered Lean in a little dear boy so you can se e Of course Burke knows Ive got this one I bought it from him and I daresay hed love to get it back when Im gone She slid back the fine filigree clasp and flipped open the box There upon the smooth crimson ve lvet lay a heavy golden locket Voldemort reached out his hand without invitation this time and held it up to the light staring at it Slytherins mark he said quietly as the light played upon an ornate serpentine S Thats right said Hepzibah delighted apparently at the sight of Voldemort gazing at her locket transfixed I had to pay an arm and a leg for it but I couldnt let it pass not a real treasure like that had to have it for my collection Burke bought it apparently from a raggedlooking woman who seemed to have stolen it but had no idea of its true value There was no mistaking it this time Voldemorts eyes flashed scarlet at the words and Harry saw his knuckles whiten on the lockets chain I daresay Burke paid her a pi ttance but there you are Pretty isnt it And again all ki nds of powers attributed to it though I just keep it nice and safe She reached out to take the locket back For a moment Harry thought Voldemort was not going to let go of it but then it had slid through his finger s and was back in its red velvet cushion CHAPTER TWENTY 438 So there you are Tom dear and I hope you enjoyed that She looked him full in the face and for the first time Harry saw her foolish smile falter Are you all right dear Oh yes said Voldemort quietly Yes Im very well I thought but a trick of the light I suppose said Hepzibah looking unnerved and Harry guessed that sh e too had seen the momentary red gleam in Voldemorts eyes Here Hokey take these away and lock them up again Th e usual enchantments Time to leave Harry said Dumb ledore quietly and as the little elf bobbed away bearing the boxes Dumbledore grasped Harry once again above the elbow and to gether they rose up through oblivion and back to Dumbledores office Hepzibah Smith died two days after that little scene said Dumbledore resuming his seat an d indicating that Harry should do the same Hokey the houseel f was convicted by the Ministry of poisoning her mistresss evening cocoa by accident No way said Harry angrily I see we are of one mind said Dumbledore Certainly there are many similarities between this death and that of the Riddles In both cases somebody else took the blame someone who had a clear memory of having caused the death Hokey confessed She remembered putting somethin g in her mistresss cocoa that turned out not to be sugar but a lethal and littleknown poison said Dumbledore It was conclude d that she had not meant to do it but being old and confused LORD VOLDEMORTS REQUEST 439 Voldemort modified her memory ju st like he did with Morfin Yes that is my conclusion too said Dumbledore And just as with Morfin the Ministry was pr edisposed to suspect Hokey because she was a houseelf said Harry He had rarely felt more in sympathy with the societ y Hermione had set up SPEW Precisely said Dumbledore She was old she admitted to having tampered with the drink and nobody at the Ministry bothered to inquire further As in the case of Morfin by the time I traced her and managed to extract this memory her life was almost over but her memory of course proves nothing except that Voldemort knew of the existenc e of the cup and the locket By the time Hokey was convicted Hepzibahs family had realized that two of her greatest treasures were missing It took them a while to be sure of this for she had many hiding pl aces having always guarded her collection most je alously But before they were sure beyond doubt that the cup an d the locket were both gone the assistant who had worked at Borgin and Burkes the young man who had visited Hepzib ah so regularly and charmed her so well had resigned his post and vanished His su periors had no idea where he had gone they were as surprised as anyone at his disappearance And that was the last th at was seen or heard of Tom Riddle for a very long time Now said Dumbledore if yo u dont mind Harry I want to p a u s e o n c e m o r e t o d r a w y o u r a t tention to certain points of our story Voldemort had committed another murder whether it was his first since he killed the Riddl es I do not know but I think it was This time as you will have se en he killed not for revenge but for gain He wanted the two fabulo us trophies that poor besotted CHAPTER TWENTY 440 old woman showed him Just as he had once robbed the other children at his orphanage just as he had stolen his Uncle Morfins ring so he ran off now with He pzibahs cup and locket But said Harry frowning it seems mad Risking everything throwing away his jo b just for those Mad to you perhaps but not to Voldemort said Dumbledore I hope you will understand in due course exactly what those objects meant to him Harry but yo u must admit that it is not difficult to imagine that he saw the locket at least as rightfully his The locket maybe said Harry but why take the cup as well It had belonged to another of Hogwartss founders said Dumbledore I think he still felt a grea t pull toward the school and that he could not resist an object so steeped in Hogwarts history There were other reasons I think I hope to be able to demonstrate them to you in due course And now for the very last recollect ion I have to show you at least until you manage to retrieve Pr ofessor Slughorns memory for us Ten years separates Hokeys memory and this one ten years during which we can only guess at what Lord Voldemort was doing Harry got to his feet once more as Dumbledore emptied the last memory into the Pensieve Whose memory is it he asked Mine said Dumbledore And Harry dived after Dumbledore through the shifting silver mass landing in the very office he had just left There was Fawkes slumbering happily on his perch and there behind the desk was Dumbledore who looked very simi lar to the Dumbledore standing beside Harry though both hand s were whole and undamaged and his face was perhaps a little less lined The one difference between LORD VOLDEMORTS REQUEST 441 the presentday office and this on e was that it was snowing in the past bluish flecks were drifting past the window in the dark and building up on the outside ledge The younger Dumbledore seemed to be waiting for something and sure enough moment s after their arrival there was a knock on the door and he said Enter Harry let out a hastily stifled gasp Voldemort had entered the room His features were not thos e Harry had seen emerge from the great stone cauldron almost two ye ars ago They were not as snakelike the eyes were not yet scarlet the face not yet masklike and yet he was no longer handsome Tom Ri ddle It was as though his features had been burned and blurred they were waxy and oddly distorted and the whites of the ey es now had a permanently bloody look though the pupils were not yet the slits that Harry knew they would become He was wearing a long black cloak and his face was as pale as the snow glistening on his shoulders The Dumbledore behind the desk showed no sign of surprise Evidently this visi t had been made by appointment Good evening Tom said Dumble dore easily Wont you sit down Thank you said Voldemort and he took the seat to which Dumbledore had gestured the very seat by the looks of it that Harry had just vacated in the pres ent I heard that you had become headmaster he said and his voice was slightly higher and colder than it had been A worthy choice I am glad you approve said Dumbledore smiling May I offer you a drink That would be welcome said Vo ldemort I have come a long way CHAPTER TWENTY 442 Dumbledore stood and swept over to the cabinet where he now kept the Pensieve but which then was full of bottles Having handed Voldemort a goblet of wi ne and poured one for himself he returned to the seat behind his desk So Tom to what do I owe the pleasure Voldemort did not answer at once but merely sipped his wine They do not call me Tom anymore he said These days I am known as I know what you are known as said Dumbledore smiling pleasantly But to me Im afraid you will always be Tom Riddle It is one of the irritating things about old teachers I am afraid that they never quite forget their charges youthful beginnings He raised his glass as though to asting Voldemort whose face remained expressionless Nevertheless Harry felt the atmosphere in the room change subtly Dumbledores refusal to use Voldemorts chosen name was a refusal to allo w Voldemort to dictate the terms of the meeting and Ha rry could tell that Voldemort took it as such I am surprised you have remain ed here so long said Voldemort after a short pause I always wondered why a wizard such as yourself never wished to leave school Well said Dumbledore still smiling to a wizard such as myself there can be nothing more im portant than passing on ancient skills helping hone yo ung minds If I reme mber correctly you once saw the attraction of teaching too I see it still said Voldemort I merely wondered why you who are so often asked for advice by the Ministry and who have twice I think been offered the post of Minister LORD VOLDEMORTS REQUEST 443 Three times at the last count ac tually said Dumbledore But the Ministry never attracted me as a career Again something we have in common I think Voldemort inclined his head unsmiling and took another sip of wine Dumbledore did not break the silence that stretched between them now but waited with a look of pleasant expectancy for Voldemort to talk first I have returned he said after a little while later perhaps than Professor Dippet expected but I have returned nevertheless to request again what he once told me I was too young to have I have come to you to ask that you permit me to return to this castle to teach I think you must know that I have seen and done much since I left this place I could show and tell your students things they can gain fr om no other wizard Dumbledore considered Voldemort over the top of his own goblet for a while before speaking Yes I certainly do know that you have seen and done much s i n c e l e a v i n g u s h e s a i d q u i e t l y R u m o r s o f y o u r d o i n g s h a v e reached your old school Tom I sh ould be sorry to believe half of them Voldemorts expression remained impassive as he said Greatness inspires envy envy engender s spite spite spawns lies You must know this Dumbledore You call it greatness what you have been doing do you asked Dumbledore delicately Certainly said Voldemort and hi s eyes seemed to burn red I have experimented I have pushed the boundaries of magic further perhaps than they have ever been pushed CHAPTER TWENTY 444 Of some kinds of magic Dumbledore corrected him quietly Of some Of others you remain forgive me woefully ignorant For the first time Voldemort smiled It was a taut leer an evil thing more threatening than a look of rage The old argument he said softly But nothing I have seen in the world has supported your famous pronouncements that love is more powerful than my kind of magic Dumbledore Perhaps you have been looking in the wrong places suggested Dumbledore Well then what better place to start my fresh researches than here at Hogwarts said Voldemor t Will you let me return Will you let me share my knowledge with your students I place myself and my talents at yo ur disposal I am yours to command Dumbledore raised his eyebrows And what will become of those whom you command What will ha ppen to those who call themselves or so rumor has it the Death Eaters Harry could tell that Voldemor t had not expected Dumbledore to know this name he saw Voldem orts eyes flash red again and the slitlike nostrils flare My friends he said after a moments pause will carry on without me I am sure I am glad to hear that you co nsider them friends said Dumbledore I was under the impression that they are more in the order of servants You are mistaken said Voldemort Then if I were to go to the Hog s Head tonight I would not find a group of them Nott Rosier Mulciber Dolohov awaiting your return Devoted friends indeed to travel this far with you on LORD VOLDEMORTS REQUEST 445 a snowy night merely to wish you luck as you attempted to secure a teaching post There could be no doubt that Dumbledores detailed knowledge of those with whom he was trav eling was even less welcome to Voldemort however he rallied almost at once You are omniscient as ever Dumbledore Oh no merely friendly with the local barmen said Dumbledore lightly Now Tom Dumbledore set down hi s empty glass and dr ew himself up in his seat the tips of his fingers together in a very characteristic gesture Let us speak openly Why have you come here tonight surrounded by henchmen to request a job we both know you do not want Voldemort looked coldly surpri sed A job I do not want On the contrary Dumbledore I want it very much Oh you want to come back to Hogwarts but you do not want to teach any more than you want ed to when you were eighteen What is it youre after Tom Wh y not try an open re quest for once Voldemort sneered If you do no t want to give me a job Of course I dont said Dumble dore And I dont think for a moment you expected me to Nevertheless you came here you asked you must ha ve had a purpose Voldemort stood up He looked le ss like Tom Riddle than ever his features thick with rage This is your final word It is said Dumble dore also standing Then we have nothing more to say to each other No nothing said Dumbledore and a great sadness filled his face The time is long gone when I could frighten you with a CHAPTER TWENTY 446 burning wardrobe and force you to make repayment for your crimes But I wish I co uld Tom I wi sh I could For a second Harry was on the verge of shouting a pointless warning He was sure that Voldemorts hand had twitched toward his pocket and his wand but then the moment had passed Voldemort had turned away the door was closing and he was gone Harry felt Dumbledores hand clos e over his arm again and moments later they were standing to gether on almost the same spot but there was no snow building on the window ledge and Dumbledores hand was blackened and deadlooking once more Why said Harry at once look ing up into Dumbledores face Why did he come back Did you ever find out I have ideas said Dumbledore but no more than that What ideas sir I shall tell you Harry when you have retrieved that memory from Professor Slughorn said Dumbledore When you have that last piece of the jigsaw everything will I hope be clear to both of us Harry was still burning with cu riosity and even though Dumbledore had walked to the door and was holdin g it open for him he did not move at once Was he after the Defense Against the Dark Arts job again sir He didnt say Oh he definitely wanted th e Defense Against the Dark Arts job said Dumbledore The aftermath of our little meeting proved that You see we have ne ver been able to keep a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher for lo nger than a year since I refused the post to Lord Voldemort T W E N T Y O N E 447 THE UNKNOW ABLE ROOM arry wracked his brains over the next week as to how he was to persuade Slughorn to hand over the true memory but nothing in the nature of a brain wave occurred and he was reduced to doing what he did increasingly th ese days when at a loss poring over his Potions book hoping that the Prince would have scribbled something useful in a margin as he had done so many times before You wont find anything in there said Hermione firmly late on Sunday evening Dont start Hermione said Harry If it hadnt been for the Prince Ron wouldnt be sitting here now He would if youd just listened to Snape in our first year said Hermione dismissively Harry ignored her He had ju st found an incantation Sectumsempra scrawled in a ma rgin above the intrig uing words For H CHAPTER TWENTYONE 448 Enemies and was itching to try it out but thought it best not to in front of Hermione Instead he surreptitiously folded down the corner of the page They were sitting beside the fire in the common room the only other people awake were fellow si xth years There had been a certain amount of excitement earlie r when they had come back from dinner to find a new sign on the notice board that announced the date for their Apparition Test Those who would be seventeen on or before the first test date the tw entyfirst of April had the option of signing up for additional prac tice sessions which would take place heavily superv ised in Hogsmeade Ron had panicked on reading this notice he had still not managed to Apparate and feared he would not be ready for the test Hermione who had now achieved Apparition twice was a little more confident but Harry who would not be seventeen for another four months could not take the test whether ready or not At least you can Apparate though said Ron tensely Youll have no trouble come July Ive only done it on ce Harry reminded him he had finally managed to disappear and rematerialize insi de his hoop during their previous lesson Having wasted a lot of time wo rrying aloud about Apparition Ron was now struggling to finish a viciously difficult essay for Snape that Harry an d Hermione had alre ady completed Harry fully expected to receive low mark s on his because he had disagreed with Snape on the best way to ta ckle dementors but he did not care Slughorns memory was the mo st important thing to him now Im telling you the stupid Prince isnt going to be able to help you with this Harry said Hermio ne more loudly Theres only THE UNKNOWABLE ROOM 449 one way to force someone to do wh at you want and thats the Imperius Curse which is illegal Yeah I know that thanks said Harry not looking up from the book Thats why Im looking for something different Dumbledore says Veritaserum wont do it but there might be something else a potion or a spell Youre going about it the wrong way said Hermione Only you can get the memory Dumbledore says That must mean you can persuade Slughorn where other pe ople cant Its not a question of slipping him a potion anyone could do that How dyou spell belligerent sa id Ron shaking his quill very hard while staring at his parchm ent It cant be B U M No it isnt said Hermione pulling Rons essay toward her And augury doesnt begin O R G either What kind of quill are you using Its one of Fred and Georges SpellCheck ones but I think the charm must be wearing off Yes it must said Hermione poin ting at the title of his essay because we were asked how wed deal with dementors not Dugbogs and I dont remember you changing your name to Roonil Wazlib either Ah no said Ron staring horrorstruck at the parchment Dont say Ill have to writ e the whole thing out again Its okay we can fix it said Hermione pulling the essay toward her and taking out her wand I love you Hermione said Ron sinking back in his chair rubbing his eyes wearily Hermione turned faintly pink but merely said Dont let Lavender hear you saying that CHAPTER TWENTYONE 450 I wont said Ron into his hands Or maybe I will then shell ditch me Why dont you ditch her if you wa nt to finish it asked Harry You havent ever chucked anyone have you said Ron You and Cho just Sort of fell apart yeah said Harry Wish that would happen with me and Lavender said Ron gloomily watching Hermione sile ntly tapping each of his misspelled words with the end of her wand so that they corrected themselves on the page But the mo re I hint I want to finish it the tighter she holds on Its like going out with the giant squid There said Hermione some twenty minutes later handing back Rons essay Thanks a million said Ron C an I borrow your quill for the conclusion Harry who had found nothing usef ul in the HalfBlood Princes notes so far looked around the three of them were now the only ones left in the common room Seam us having just gone up to bed cursing Snape and his essay The on ly sounds were the crackling of the fire and Ron scratching out one last paragraph on dementors using Hermiones quill Harry ha d just closed the HalfBlood Princes book yawning when Crack Hermione let out a little shriek Ron spilled ink all over his freshly completed essay and Harry said Kreacher The houseelf bowed low and addressed his own gnarled toes Master said he wanted regular reports on what the Malfoy boy is doing so Kreacher has come to give THE UNKNOWABLE ROOM 451 Crack Dobby appeared alongs ide Kreacher his teacozy hat askew Dobby has been helping too Harry Potter he squeaked casting Kreacher a resentful look And Kreacher ought to tell Dobby when he is coming to see Harry Po tter so they can make their reports together What is this asked Hermione still looking shocked by these sudden appearances Wha ts going on Harry Harry hesitated before answering because he had not told Hermione about setting Kreacher an d Dobby to tail Malfoy houseelves were always such a touchy subject with her Well theyve be en following Malfoy for me he said Night and day croaked Kreacher Dobby has not slept for a week Harry Potter said Dobby proudly swaying where he stood Hermione looked indignant You havent slept Dobby But surely Harry you didnt tell him not to No of course I didnt said Harry quickly Dobby you can sleep all right But has either of you found out anything he hastened to ask before Hermione could intervene again Master Malfoy moves with a nobility that befits his pure blood croaked Kreacher at once His feat ures recall the fine bones of my mistress and hi s manners are those of Draco Malfoy is a bad boy squeaked Dobby angrily A bad boy who who He shuddered from the tassel of his tea cozy to the toes of his socks and then ran at the fire as though about to dive into it CHAPTER TWENTYONE 452 Harry to whom this was not en tirely unexpected caught him around the middle and held him fast For a few seconds Dobby struggled then went limp Thank you Harry Potter he pant ed Dobby still finds it difficult to speak ill of his old masters Harry released him Dobby straight ened his tea cozy and said defiantly to Kreacher But Kreach er should know that Draco Malfoy is not a good mast er to a houseelf Yeah we dont need to hear about you being in love with Malfoy Harry told Kreacher Lets fast forward to where hes actually been going Kreacher bowed again looking furious and then said Master Malfoy eats in the Great Hall he sleeps in a dormitory in the dungeons he attends his clas ses in a variety of Dobby you tell me said Harry cutting across Kreacher Has he been going anywhere he shouldnt have Harry Potter sir squeaked Dobb y his great orblike eyes shining in the firelight the Malfoy b o y i s b r e a k i n g n o r u l e s t h a t Dobby can discover but he is sti ll keen to avoid detection He has been making regular visits to the seventh floor with a variety of other students who keep watch for him while he enters The Room of Requirement sa id Harry smacking himself hard on the forehead with Advanced PotionMaking Hermione and Ron stared at him Thats where hes been sneaking off to Thats where hes doing whatever hes doing And I bet thats why hes been disappearing off the map co me to think of it Ive never seen the Room of Re quirement on there Maybe the Marauders never knew the room was there said Ron THE UNKNOWABLE ROOM 453 I think itll be part of the ma gic of the room said Hermione If you need it to be Unplottable it will be Dobby have you managed to get in to have a look at what Malfoys doing said Harry eagerly No Harry Potter that is impossible said Dobby No its not said Harry at on ce Malfoy got into our headquarters there last year so Ill be able to get in and spy on him no problem But I dont think you will Ha rry said Hermione slowly Malfoy already knew exactly how we were using the room didnt he because that stupid Marietta had blabbed He needed the room to become the headquarters of the DA so it did But you dont know what the room becomes when Malfoy goes in there so you dont know what to ask it to transform into Therell be a way around that said Harry dismissively Youve done brilliantly Dobby Kreachers done well too said Hermione kindly but far from looking grateful Kreacher aver ted his huge bloodshot eyes and croaked at the ceiling The Mu dblood is speaking to Kreacher Kreacher will pretend he cannot hear Get out of it Harry snapped at him and Kreacher made one last deep bow and Disapparated Youd better go and get some sleep too Dobby Thank you Harry Potter sir squeaked Dobby happily and he too vanished How goods this said Harry en thusiastically turning to Ron and Hermione the moment the room was elffree again We know where Malfoys going Wev e got him cornered now Yeah its great said Ron gl umly who was attempting to mop CHAPTER TWENTYONE 454 up the sodden mass of ink that ha d recently been an almost completed essay Hermione pulled it toward her and began siphoning the ink off with her wand But whats all this about him going up there with a variety of students said Hermione How many people are in on it You wouldnt think hed trust lots of them to know what hes doing Yeah that is weird said Harry frowning I heard him telling Crabbe it wasnt Crabbes business what he was doing so whats he telling all these all these Harrys voice tailed away he was staring at the fire God Ive been stupid he said quietly Its obvious isnt it There was a great vat of it down in the dungeon He couldve nicked some any time duri ng that lesson Nicked what said Ron Polyjuice Potion He stole some of the Polyjuice Potion Slughorn showed us in our first Potions lesson There arent a whole variety of students standing guard fo r Malfoy its just Crabbe and Goyle as usual Yeah it all fits said Harry jumping up and starting to pace in front of th e fire Theyre stupid enough to do what theyre told even if he wont tell them what hes up to but he doesnt want them to be seen lurking around outside the Room of Requirement so hes got them taking Polyjuice to make them look like other people Those two girls I saw him with when he missed Quidditch ha Crabbe and Goyle Do you mean to say said Hermione in a hushed voice that that little girl whose scales I repaired Yeah of course said Harry loud ly staring at her Of course Malfoy mustve been inside the r oom at the time so she what THE UNKNOWABLE ROOM 455 am I talking about he dropped the scales to tell Malfoy not to come out because there was someone there And there was that girl who dropped the toadspawn too We ve been walking past him all the time and not realizing it Hes got Crabbe and Goyle tran sforming into girls guffawed Ron Blimey No wonder they dont look too happy these days Im surprised they dont tell him to stuff it Well they wouldnt would they if hes shown them his Dark Mark said Harry Hmmm the Dark Mark we don t know exists said Hermione skeptically rolling up Rons dr ied essay before it could come to any more harm and handing it to him Well see said Harry confidently Yes we will Hermione said getti ng to her feet and stretching But Harry before you get all excited I still dont think youll be able to get into the Room of Requirement without knowing whats there first And I dont think you should forget she heaved her bag onto her shoulder and gave him a very serious look that what youre supposed to be concentrating on is getting that memory from Slughorn Good night Harry watched her go feeling sl ightly disgruntled Once the door to the girls dormitories had closed behind her he rounded on Ron What dyou think Wish I could Disapparate like a ho useelf said Ron staring at the spot where Dobby had vanished Id have that Apparition Test in the bag Harry did not sleep well that night He lay awake for what felt like hours wondering how Malfoy was using the Room of Requirement CHAPTER TWENTYONE 456 and what he Harry would see when he went in there the following day for whatever Hermione said Ha rry was sure that if Malfoy had been able to see the headquarters of the DA he would be able to see Malfoys what could it be A meeting place A hideout A storeroom A workshop Harrys mind wo rked feverishly and his dreams when he finally fell asleep were broken and disturbed by images of Malfoy who turned into Slughorn who turned into Snape Harry was in a state of great anticipation over breakfast the following morning he had a free period before Defense Against the Dark Arts and was determined to spend it trying to get into the Room of Requirement Hermione was rather ostentatiously showing no interest in his whispered plans for forcing entry into the room which irritated Harry becaus e he thought she might be a lot of help if she wanted to Look he said quietly leaning forward and putting a hand on the Daily Prophet which she had just removed from a post owl to stop her from opening it and vanishing behind it I havent forgotten about Slughorn but I haven t got a clue how to get that memory off him and until I get a brain wave why shouldnt I find out what Malfoys doing Ive already told you you need to persuade Slughorn said Hermione Its not a question of tricking him or bewitching him or Dumbledore could have done it in a second Instead of messing around outside the Room of Requirement she jerked the Prophet out from under Harrys hand and unfolded it to look at the front page you should go and find Slughorn and start appealing to his better nature Anyone we know asked Ron as Hermione scanned the headlines THE UNKNOWABLE ROOM 457 Yes said Hermione causing both Harry and Ron to gag on their breakfast But its all right hes not dead its Mundungus hes been arrested and sent to Azkaban Something to do with impersonating an Inferius during an attempted burglary and someone called Octavius Pepper ha s vanished Oh and how horrible a nineyearold boy has been arrested for trying to kill his grandparents they think he was un der the Imperius Curse They finished their breakfast in silence Hermione set off immediately for Ancient Runes Ron for the common room where he still had to finish his conclusion on Snapes dementor essay and Harry for the corridor on the seventh floor and the stretch of wall opposite the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy teaching trolls to do ballet Harry slipped on his Invisibility Cloak once he had found an empty passage but he need not have bothered When he reached his destination he found it dese rted Harry was not sure whether his chances of getting inside the room were better with Malfoy inside it or out but at least his fi rst attempt was not going to be complicated by the presence of Crabbe or Goyle pretending to be an elevenyearold girl He closed his eyes as he appr oached the place where the Room of Requirements door was concealed He knew what he had to do he had become most accomplished at it last year Concentrating with all his might he thought I need to see what Malfoys doing in here I need to see what Malfoys doing in here I need to see what Malfoys doing in here Three times he walked past th e door then his heart pounding with excitement he opened his eyes and faced it But he was still looking at a st retch of mundanely blank wall CHAPTER TWENTYONE 458 He moved forward and gave it an experimental push The stone remained solid and unyielding Okay said Harry aloud O kay I thought the wrong thing He pondered for a moment then set off again eyes closed concentrating as hard as he could I need to see the place where Malfoy keeps coming secretly I need to see the place where Ma lfoy keeps coming secretly After three walks past he op ened his eyes expectantly There was no door Oh come off it he told the wa ll irritably That was a clear instruction Fine He thought hard for several minu tes before striding off once more I need you to become the place you become for Draco Malfoy He did not immediately open his eyes when he had finished his patrolling he was list ening hard as though he might hear the door pop into existence He heard noth ing however except the distant twittering of birds outside He opened his eyes There was still no door Harry swore Someone screamed He looked around to see a gaggle of first years running back around the corner apparently under the impression that they had just encountered a particularly foulmouthed ghost Harry tried every variation of I need to see what Draco Malfoy is doing inside you that he coul d think of for a whole hour at the end of which he was forced to co ncede that Hermione might have had a point The room simply did not want to open for him Frustrated and annoyed he set off for Defense Against the Dark Arts THE UNKNOWABLE ROOM 459 pulling off his Invisibility Cloak an d stuffing it into his bag as he went Late again Potter said Snape coldly as Harry hurried into the candlelit classroom Ten points from Gryffindor Harry scowled at Snape as he flun g himself into the seat beside Ron half the class was still on its feet taking ou t books and organizing their thin gs he could not be much later than any of them Before we start I want your dementor essays said Snape waving his wand carelessly so that twentyfive scrolls of parchment soared into the air and landed in a neat pile on his desk And I hope for your sakes they are better than the tripe I had to endure on resisting the Imperius Curse Now if you will all open your books to page what is it Mr Finnigan Sir said Seamus Ive been wondering how do you tell the difference between an Inferius and a ghost Because there was something in the paper about an Inferius No there wasnt said Snape in a bored voice But sir I heard people talking If you had actually read the ar ticle in question Mr Finnigan you would have known th at the socalled Infe rius was nothing but a smelly sneak thief by the na me of Mundungus Fletcher I thought Snape and Mundungus were on the same side muttered Harry to Ron and Hermione Shouldnt he be upset Mundungus has been arrest But Potter seems to have a lot to say on the subject said Snape pointing suddenly at the ba ck of the room his black eyes fixed on Harry Let us ask Potter how we would tell the difference between an Inferi us and a ghost The whole class looked around at Harry who hastily tried to CHAPTER TWENTYONE 460 recall what Dumbledore had told him the night that they had gone to visit Slughorn Er well ghosts are transparent he said Oh very good interrupted Snape his lip curling Yes it is easy to see that nearly six years of magical education have not been wasted on you Potter Ghosts are transparent Pansy Parkinson let out a highpi tched giggle Several other people were smirking Harry took a deep breath and continued calmly though his insides were boiling Yeah ghosts are transparent but Inferi are dead bodies arent they So theyd be solid A fiveyearold could have told us as much sneered Snape The Inferius is a corpse that has been reanimated by a Dark wizards spells It is not alive it is merely used like a puppet to do the wizards bidding A ghost as I trus t that you are al l aware by now is the imprint of a departed soul left upon the earth and of course as Potter so wisely tells us transparent Well what Harry said is the most useful if were trying to tell them apart said Ron Whe n we come facetoface with one down a dark alley were going to be having a shufti to see if its solid arent we were not going to be asking Excuse me are you the imprint of a departed soul There was a ripple of laughter instantly quelled by the look Snape gave the class Another ten points from Gryffin dor said Snape I would expect nothing more sophisticated from you Ronald Weasley the boy so solid he cannot Apparate half an inch across a room No whispered Hermione grabbing Harrys arm as he opened his mouth furiously Theres no po int youll just end up in detention again leave it THE UNKNOWABLE ROOM 461 Now open your books to page two hundred and thirteen said Snape smirking a little and read the first two paragraphs on the Cruciatus Curse Ron was very subdued all through the class When the bell sounded at the end of the lesson Lavender caught up with Ron and Harry Hermione mysteriously melted out of sight as she approached and abused Snape hotly for his jibe about Rons Apparition but this seemed to merely irritate Ron and he shook her off by making a detour into the bo ys bathroom with Harry Snapes right though isnt he said Ron after staring into a cracked mirror for a minute or tw o I dunno whether its worth me taking the test I just cant get the hang of Apparition You might as well do the extra practice sessions in Hogsmeade and see where they get you said Harry reasonably Itll be more interesting than trying to get into a stupid hoop anyway Then if youre still not you know as good as youd like to be you can postpone the test do it with me ov er the summ Myrtle this is the boys bathroom The ghost of a girl had risen out of the toilet in a cubicle behind them and was now floating in midair staring at them through thick white round glasses Oh she said glumly Its you two Who were you expecting said Ron looking at her in the mirror Nobody said Myrtle picking m oodily at a spot on her chin He said hed come back and see me but then you said youd pop in and visit me too she gave Harry a reproach ful look and I havent seen you for months and months Ive learned not to expect too much from boys CHAPTER TWENTYONE 462 I thought you lived in that girl s bathroom sa id Harry who had been careful to give the place a wide bert h for some years now I do she said with a sulky little shrug but that doesnt mean I cant visit other places I came and sa w you in your bath once remember Vividly said Harry But I thought he liked me she said plaintively Maybe if you two left hed come back again We had lots in common Im sure he felt it And she looked hopefu lly toward the door When you say you had lots in common said Ron sounding rather amused now dyou mean he lives in an Sbend too No said Myrtle defiantly her voice echoing loudly around the old tiled bathroom I mean hes sensitive people bully him too and he feels lonely and hasnt got anybody to talk to and hes not afraid to show his feelings and cry Theres been a boy in here cryi ng said Harry curiously A young boy Never you mind said Myrtle her small leaky eyes fixed on Ron who was now definitely grinni ng I promised I wouldnt tell anyone and Ill take his secret to the not the grave surely said Ron with a snort The sewers maybe Myrtle gave a howl of rage and dived back into the toilet causing water to slop over the sides and onto the floor Goading Myrtle seemed to have put fresh heart into Ron Youre right he said swinging his schoolbag back over his shoulder Ill do the practice sess ions in Hogsmeade before I decide about taking the test THE UNKNOWABLE ROOM 463 And so the following weekend Ron joined Hermione and the rest of the sixth years who would turn seventeen in time to take the test in a fortnight Harry felt rath er jealous watchin g them all get ready to go into the vi llage he missed making trips there and it was a particularly fine spring day one of the first clear skies they had seen in a long time However he had decided to use the time to attempt another assault on the Room of Requirement Youd do better said Hermione when he confided this plan to Ron and her in the entrance hall t o go straight to Slughorns office and try and get that memory from him Ive been trying said Harry cro ssly which was perfectly true He had lagged behind after every Po tions lesson that week in an attempt to corner Slughorn but the Potions master always left the dungeon so fast that Harry had no t been able to ca tch him Twice Harry had gone to his office and kn ocked but received no reply though on the second occasion he was sure he had heard the quickly stifled sounds of an old gramophone He doesnt want to talk to me Hermione He can tell Ive been trying to get him on his own again and hes not going to let it happen Well youve just got to keep at it havent you The short queue of people waiting to file past Filch who was doing his usual prodding act with the Secrecy Sensor moved forward a few steps and Harry did not answer in case he was overheard by the caretaker He wished Ron and He rmione both luck then turned and climbed the marble staircase again determined whatever Hermione said to devote an hour or two to the Room of Requirement Once out of sight of the entrance hall Harry pulled the Marauders Map and his Invisibility Cloak from his bag Having CHAPTER TWENTYONE 464 concealed himself he tapped the map murmured I solemnly swear that I am up to no good and scanned it carefully As it was Sunday morning near ly all the students were inside their various common rooms the Gryffindors in one tower the Ravenclaws in another the Slyt herins in the dungeons and the Hufflepuffs in the basement near the kitchens Here and there a stray person meandered around th e library or up a corridor There were a few people out in the grounds and there alone in the seventhfloor corridor was Gr egory Goyle There was no sign of the Room of Requirement but Harry was not worried about that if Goyle was standing guar d outside it the room was open whether the map was aware of it or not He therefore sprinted up the stairs slowing down only when he reached the corner into the corridor when he began to creep ve ry slowly toward the very same little girl clutching her heavy br ass scales that Hermione had so kindly helped a fortnight before He waited until he was right behind her before bending very lo w and whispering Hello youre very pretty arent you Goyle gave a highpitched scream of terror threw the scales up into the air and sprinted away va nishing from sight long before the sound of the scales smashing had stopped echoing around the corridor Laughing Harry turned to co ntemplate the blank wall behind which he was sure Draco Malfoy was now standing frozen aware that someone unwelcome was out ther e but not daring to make an appearance It gave Harry a most ag reeable feeling of power as he tried to remember what form of words he had not yet tried Yet this hopeful mood did not last long Half an hour later having tried many more variations of his request to see what Malfoy was up to the wall was just as door less as ever Harry felt frustrated THE UNKNOWABLE ROOM 465 beyond belief Malfoy might be ju st feet away from him and there was still not the tiniest shred of ev idence as to what he was doing in there Losing his patience comple tely Harry ran at the wall and kicked it OUCH He thought he might have broken his toe as he clutched it and hopped on one foot the Invisi bility Cloak slipped off him Harry He spun around onelegged and toppled over There to his utter astonishment was Tonks walk ing toward him as though she frequently strolled up this corridor Whatre you doing here he said scrambling to his feet again why did she always have to find him lying on the floor I came to see Dumbledore said Tonks Harry thought she looked terribl e thinner than usual her mousecolored hair lank His office isnt here said Ha rry its round the other side of the castle behind the gargoyle I know said Tonks Hes not there Apparently hes gone away again Has he said Harry putting his bruised foot gingerly back on the floor Hey you dont know where he goes I suppose No said Tonks What did you want to see him about Nothing in particular said To nks picking apparently unconsciously at the sleeve of her robe I just thought he might know whats going on Ive heard rumors people getting hurt Yeah I know its al l been in the papers said Harry That little kid trying to kill his CHAPTER TWENTYONE 466 The Prophets often behind the times said Tonks who didnt seem to be listening to him You havent had any letters from anyone in the Order recently No one from the Order writes to me anymore said Harry not since Sirius He saw that her eyes had filled with tears Im sorry he muttered awkwardly I mean I miss him as well What said Tonks blankly as though she had not heard him Well Ill see you around Harry And she turned abruptly and walked back down the corridor leaving Harry to stare after her After a minute or so he pulled the Invisibility Cloak on again and re sumed his efforts to get into the Room of Requirement but his heart was not in it Finally a hollow feeling in his stomach and the kn owledge that Ron and Hermione would soon be back for lunch ma de him abandon the attempt and leave the corridor to Malfoy who hopefully would be too afraid to leave for some hours to come He found Ron and Hermione in th e Great Hall already halfway through an early lunch I did it well kind of Ron told Harry enthusiastically when he caught sight of him I was supposed to be Apparating to outside Madam Puddifoots Tea Shop an d I overshot it a bit ended up near Scrivenshafts but at least I moved Good one said Harry H owd you do Hermione Oh she was perfect obviousl y said Ron before Hermione could answer Perfect deliberation divination and desperation or whatever the hell it is we all w ent for a quick drink in the Three Broomsticks after and you shouldve heard Twycross going on THE UNKNOWABLE ROOM 467 about her Ill be surprised if he doesnt pop the question soon And what about you asked He rmione ignoring Ron Have you been up at the Room of Requirement all this time Yep said Harry And guess wh o I ran into up there Tonks Tonks repeated Ron and Hermione together looking surprised Yeah she said shed come to visit Dumbledore If you ask me said Ron once Harry had finished describing his conversation with Tonks shes cr acking up a bit Losing her nerve after what happened at the Ministry Its a bit odd said Hermione who for some reason looked very concerned Shes supposed to be guarding the school whys she suddenly abandoning her post to come and see Dumbledore when hes not even here I had a thought said Harry tent atively He felt strange about voicing it this was much more He rmiones territory than his You dont think she can have been you know in love with Sirius Hermione stared at him What on earth makes you say that I dunno said Harry shruggin g but she was nearly crying when I mentioned his name and her Patronus is a big fourlegged thing now I wondered whether it hadnt become you know him Its a thought said Hermione slowly But I still dont know why shed be bursting into the castle to see Dumbledore if thats really why she wa s here Goes back to what I said doesn t it said Ron who was now shoveling mashed potato into his mouth Shes gone a bit funny CHAPTER TWENTYONE 468 Lost her nerve Women he said wisely to Harry theyre easily upset And yet said Hermione coming out of her reverie I doubt youd find a woman who sulked for half an hour because Madam Rosmerta didnt laugh at their joke about the hag the Healer and the Mimbulus mimbletonia Ron scowled T W E N T Y T W O 469 AFTER THE BURIAL a t c h e s o f b r i g h t b l u e s k y w e r e b e g i n n i n g t o a p p e a r o v e r t h e castle turrets but these signs of approaching summer did not lift Harrys mood He had been thwa rted both in his attempts to find out what Malfoy was doing and in his efforts to start a conversation with Slughorn that might lead somehow to Slughorn handing over the memory he had appa rently suppressed for decades For the last time just forget about Malfoy Hermione told Harry firmly They were sitting with Ron in a sunny corner of the courtyard after lunch Hermione and Ron were both clutching a Ministry of Magic leaflet Common Apparition Mistakes and How to Avoid Them for they were taking their tests that very afternoon but by and large the leaflets had not proved soot hing to the nerves Ron gave a start and tried to hide behind Hermione as a girl came around the corner It isnt Lavender said Hermione wearily P CHAPTER TWENTYTWO 470 Oh good said Ron relaxing Harry Potter said the girl I was asked to give you this Thanks Harrys heart sank as he took the small scroll of parchment Once the girl was out of earsho t he said Dumbledore said we wouldnt be having any more le ssons until I got the memory Maybe he wants to check on how youre doing suggested Hermione as Harry unrolled the parchment but rather than finding Dumbledores long narrow slan ted writing he saw an untidy sprawl very difficult to read due to the presence of large blotches on the parchment wher e the ink had run Dear Harry Ron and Hermione Aragog died last night Ha rry and Ron you met him and you know how special he was Hermione I know youd have liked him It would mean a lot to me if youd nip down for the burial later this evening Im planning on doing it round dusk that was his favorite time of day I know youre not supposed to be out that late but you can use the cloak Wouldnt ask but I cant face it alone Hagrid Look at this said Harry ha nding the note to Hermione Oh for heavens sake she said scanning it quickly and passing it to Ron who read it through looking increasingly incredulous Hes mental he said furiously That thing told its mates to eat AFTER THE BURIAL 471 Harry and me Told them to help themselves And now Hagrid expects us to go down there and cry over its horrible hairy body Its not just that said Hermio ne Hes asking us to leave the castle at night and he knows securitys a million times tighter and how much trouble wed be in if we were caught Weve been down to see him by night before said Harry Yes but for something like this said Hermione Weve risked a lot to help Hagrid out but after all Aragogs dead If it were a question of saving him Id want to go even less sa id Ron firmly You didnt meet him Hermione Believe me being de ad will have improved him a lot Harry took the note back and stared down at all the inky blotches all over it Tears had clea rly fallen thick and fast upon the parchment Harry you cant be thinking of going said Hermione Its such a pointless thing to get detention for Harry sighed Yeah I know he sa id I spose Hagridll have to bury Aragog without us Yes he will said Hermione looking relieved Look Potions will be almost empty th is afternoon with us all off doing our tests Try and soften Slug horn up a bit then Fiftyseventh time lucky you think said Harry bitterly Lucky said Ron suddenly H arry thats it get lucky What dyou mean Use your lu cky potion Ron thats thats it said Hermione sounding stunned Of course Why didnt I think of it CHAPTER TWENTYTWO 472 Harry stared at them bo th Felix Felicis he said I dunno I was sort of saving it What for demanded Ron incredulously What on earth is more import ant than this memory Harry asked Hermione Harry did not answer The thought of that little golden bottle had hovered on the edge s of his imagination for some time vague and unformulated plans that invo lved Ginny splitting up with Dean and Ron somehow being ha ppy to see her with a new boyfriend had been fermenting in the depths of his brain unacknowledged except during dreams or the twilight time between sleeping and waking Harry Are you still with us asked Hermione Wha Yeah of course he said pulling himself together Well okay If I cant get Sl ughorn to talk this afternoon Ill take some Felix and have another go this evening Thats decided then said Herm ione briskly getting to her feet and performing a graceful pirouette Destination determination deliberation she murmured Oh stop that Ron begged her I feel sick enough as it is quick hide me It isnt Lavender said Hermio ne impatiently as another couple of girls appeared in the cour tyard and Ron dived behind her Cool said Ron peering over Hermiones shoulder to check Blimey they dont look happy do they Theyre the Montgomery sisters an d of course they dont look happy didnt you hear what happened to their little brother said Hermione AFTER THE BURIAL 473 Im losing track of whats happe ning to everyones relatives to be honest said Ron Well their brother was attacked by a werewolf The rumor is that their mother refused to help the Death Eaters Anyway the boy was only five and he di ed in St Mungos they couldnt save him He died repeated Harry shocked But surely werewolves dont kill they just turn you into one of them They sometimes kill said Ro n who looked unusually grave now Ive heard of it happening when the werewolf gets carried away What was the werewolfs na me said Harry quickly Well the rumor is that it wa s that Fenrir Greyback said Hermione I knew it the maniac who likes attacking kids the one Lupin told me about said Harry angrily Hermione looked at him bleakly Harry youve got to get that memory she said Its all about stopping Voldemort isnt it Thes e dreadful things that are happening are all down to him The bell rang overhead in the castle and both Hermione and Ron jumped to their fee t looking terrified Youll do fine Harry told them both as they headed toward the entrance hall to meet the rest of the people taking their Apparition Test Good luck And you too said Hermione with a significant look as Harry headed off to the dungeons There were only three of them in Potions that afternoon Harry Ernie and Draco Malfoy CHAPTER TWENTYTWO 474 All too young to Apparate just yet said Slughorn genially Not turned seventeen yet They shook their heads Ah well said Slughorn cheerily as were so few well do something fun I want you all to brew me up something amusing That sounds good sir said Er nie sycophantically rubbing his hands together Malfoy on the other hand di d not crack a smile What do you mean something am using he said irritably Oh surprise me said Slughorn airily Malfoy opened his copy of Advanced PotionMaking with a sulky expression It could not have been plainer that he thought this lesson was a waste of time Undoubtedly Harry thought watching him over the top of his own book Malfoy was begrudging the time he could otherwise be spending in the Room of Requirement Was it his imagination or did Ma lfoy like Tonks look thinner Certainly he looked paler his sk in still had that grayish tinge probably because he so rarely saw daylight these days But there was no air of smugness excitement or superiority none of the swagger that he had had on the Hogwarts Express when he had boasted openly of the mission he had been given by Voldemort There could be only one conclusion in Harrys opinion The mission whatever it was was going badly Cheered by this thought Harry skimmed through his copy of Advanced PotionMaking and found a heavily corrected HalfBlood Princes version of An Elixir to Induce Euphoria which seemed not only to meet Slughorns inst ructions but whic h might Harrys heart leapt as the thought struck him put Slughorn into such a good mood that he woul d be prepared to hand over that memory if Harry could persuade him to taste some AFTER THE BURIAL 475 Well now this looks absolutely wonderful said Slughorn an hour and a half later clapping hi s hands together as he stared down into the sunshine yellow contents of Harrys cauldron Euphoria I take it And whats that I smell Mmmm you ve added just a sprig of peppermint havent you Unorth odox but what a stroke of inspiration Harry of course that woul d tend to counterbalance the occasional side effects of excessive sin ging and nosetweaking I really dont know where you get these brai n waves my boy unless Harry pushed the HalfBlood Princes book deeper into his bag with his foot its just your mothers genes coming out in you Oh yeah maybe said Harry relieved Ernie was looking rather grumpy determined to outshine Harry for once he had most rashly invented his own potion which had curdled and formed a kind of purple dumpling at the bottom of his cauldron Malfoy was already packing up sourfaced Slughorn had pronounced his Hiccuping Solution merely passable The bell rang and both Erni e and Malfoy left at once Sir Harry began but Slughorn immediately glanced over his shoulder when he saw that the room was empty but for himself and Harry he hurried away as fast as he could Professor Professor dont you want to taste my po called Harry desperately But Slughorn had gone Disappointed Harry emptied the cauldron packed up his things left the dungeon and walked slowly back upstairs to the common room Ron and Hermione returned in the late afternoon Harry cried Hermione as she climbed through the portrait hole Harry I passed CHAPTER TWENTYTWO 476 Well done he said And Ron He he just failed whispered Hermione as Ron came slouching into the room looking most morose It was really unlucky a tiny thing the examiner ju st spotted that hed left half an eyebrow behind How di d it go with Slughorn No joy said Harry as Ron join ed them Bad luck mate but youll pass next time we can take it together Yeah I spose said Ron grumpily But half an eyebrow Like that matters I know said Hermione soothingly it does seem really harsh They spent most of their dinner roundly abusing the Apparition examiner and Ron looked fraction ally more cheerful by the time they set off back to the common room now discussing the continuing problem of Slughorn and the memory So Harry you going to use the Felix Felicis or what Ron demanded Yeah I spose Id better said Ha rry I dont reckon Ill need all of it not twelve hours worth it cant take all night Ill just take a mouthful Two or th ree hours should do it Its a great feeling when you take it said Ron reminiscently Like you cant do anything wrong What are you talking about sa id Hermione laughing Youve never taken any Yeah but I thought I had didnt I said Ron as though explaining the obvious Same difference really As they had only just seen Slughorn enter the Great Hall and knew that he liked to take time ov er meals they lingered for a while in the common room the plan being that Harry should go to AFTER THE BURIAL 477 Slughorns office once the teacher had had time to get back there When the sun had sunk to the leve l of the treetops in the Forbidden Forest they deci ded the moment had come and after checking carefully that Neville Dean and Seamus were all in the common room sneake d up to the boys dormitory Harry took out the rolledup sock s at the bottom of his trunk and extracted the tiny gleaming bottle Well here goes said Harry and he raised the little bottle and took a carefully measured gulp What does it feel like whispered Hermione Harry did not answer for a moment Then slowly but surely an exhilarating sense of infinite oppo rtunity stole through him he felt as though he could have done anyt hing anything at all and getting the memory from Slughorn seemed suddenly not only possible but positively easy He got to his feet smiling brimming with confidence Excellent he said Really excellent Right Im going down to Hagrids What said Ron and Hermione together looking aghast No Harry youve got to go and see Slughorn remember said Hermione No said Harry confidently Im going to Hagrids Ive got a good feeling about go ing to Hagrids Youve got a good feeling about burying a giant spider asked Ron looking stunned Yeah said Harry pulling his Invi sibility Cloak ou t of his bag I feel like its the place to be tonight you know what I mean No said Ron and Hermione toge ther both looking positively alarmed now CHAPTER TWENTYTWO 478 This is Felix Felicis I suppose sa id Hermione anxiously holding up the bottle to th e light You havent go t another little bottle full of I don t know Essence of Insanity suggested Ron as Harry swung his cloak over his shoulders Harry laughed and Ron and He rmione looked even more alarmed Trust me he said I know what Im doing or at least he strolled confidently to the door Felix does He pulled the Invisibility Cloa k over his head and set off down the stairs Ron and Hermione hurryi ng along behind him At the foot of the stairs Harry slid through the open door What were you doing up there with her shrieked Lavender Brown staring right through Harry at Ron and Hermione emerging together from the boys dormitories Harry heard Ron spluttering behind him as he darted acro ss the room aw ay from them Getting through the portrait hole was simple as he approached it Ginny and Dean came through it and Harry was able to slip between them As he did so he brushed accidentally against Ginny Dont push me please Dean sh e said sounding annoyed Youre always doing that I can get through perfectly well on my own The portrait swung closed behind Harry but not before he had heard Dean make an an gry retort His feeling of elation increasing Harry strode off through the castle He did not have to creep along for he met nobody on his way but this did not surprise him in the slightest This evening he was the luckiest person at Hogwarts Why he knew that going to Hagrids was the right thing to do AFTER THE BURIAL 479 he had no idea It was as though the potion was illuminating a few steps of the path at a time He could not see the final destination he could not see where Slughorn ca me in but he knew that he was going the right way to get that memory When he reached the entrance hall he saw that Filch had forgotten to lock the front door Beaming Harry threw it open and breathed in the smell of clean air and grass for a moment before walking down the steps into the dusk It was when he reached the bottom step that it occurred to him how very pleasant it would be to pass the vegetable patch on his walk to Hagrids It was not strictly on the way but it seemed clear to Harry that this was a whim on which he should act so he directed his feet immediately toward the vegetable patch where he was pleased but not altogether surprised to find Professor Slughorn in conversation with Professor Sprout Harry lurked behind a low stone wall feeling at pe ace with the world and listening to their conversation I do thank you for ta king the time Pomona Slughorn was saying courteously most authorities agree that they are at their most efficacious if pi cked at twilight Oh I quite agree said Profe ssor Sprout warmly That enough for you Plenty plenty said Slughorn who Harry saw was carrying an armful of leafy plants This should allow for a few leaves for each of my third years and some to spare if anybody overstews them Well good evening to yo u and many th anks again Professor Sprout headed off into the gathering darkness in the direction of her greenhouses and Sl ughorn directed his steps to the spot where Harry stood invisible CHAPTER TWENTYTWO 480 Seized with an immediate desire to reveal himself Harry pulled off the cloak with a flourish Good evening Professor Merlins beard Harry you made me jump said Slughorn stopping dead in his tracks an d looking wary How did you get out of the castle I think Filch mustve forgotten to lock the doors said Harry cheerfully and was delighted to see Slughorn scowl Ill be reporting that man he s more concerned about litter than proper security if you ask me But why are you out here Harry W e l l s i r i t s H a g r i d s a i d H a r r y w h o k n e w t h a t t h e r i g h t thing to do just now was to tell th e truth Hes pretty upset But you wont tell anyone Professor I dont want trouble for him Slughorns curiosity was evidently aroused Well I cant promise that he said gruffly But I know that Dumbledore trusts Hagrid to the hilt so Im sure he cant be up to anything very dreadful Well its this giant spider hes had it for years It lived in the forest It could talk and everything I heard rumors there were acro mantulas in the forest said Slughorn softly looking over at the mass of black trees Its true then Yes said Harry But this one Aragog the first one Hagrid ever got it died last night Hes devastated He wants company while he buries it and I said Id go Touching touching said Slug horn absentmindedly his large droopy eyes fixed upon the distant lights of Hagrids cabin But AFTER THE BURIAL 481 acromantula venom is very valuable If the beast only just died it might not yet have dried out Of course I wouldnt want to do anything insensitive if Hagrid is upset but if there was any way to procure some I mean its almost impossible to get venom from an acromantula while its alive Slughorn seemed to be talking more to himself than Harry now seems an awful waste not to collect it might get a hundred Galleons a pint To be frank my sala ry is not large And now Harry saw clearly what was to be done Well he said with a most conv incing hesitancy well if you wanted to come Professor Hagr id would probably be really pleased Give Aragog a be tter sendoff you know Yes of course said Slughorn his eyes now gleaming with enthusiasm I tell you what Harry Ill meet you down there with a bottle or two Well drink the poor beasts well not health but well send it off in style anyway once its buried And Ill change my tie this one is a little exuberant for the occasion He bustled back into the castle and Harry sped off to Hagrids delighted wi th himself Yeh came croaked Hagrid when he opened the door and saw Harry emerging from the Invisi bility Cloak in front of him Yeah Ron and Hermione coul dnt though said Harry Theyre really sorry Don don matter Hedv e bin touched yehre here though Harry Hagrid gave a great sob He had made himself a black armband out of what looked like a rag dipp ed in boot polish and his eyes CHAPTER TWENTYTWO 482 were puffy red and swollen Ha rry patted him consolingly on the elbow which was the highest point of Hagrid he could easily reach Where are we burying him he asked The forest Blimey no said Hagrid wiping his streaming eyes on the bottom of his shirt The other spid ers won let me anywhere near their webs now Aragogs gone Turn s out it was ony on his orders they didn eat me Can yeh believe that Harry The honest answer was yes Ha rry recalled with painful ease the scene when he and Ron had come facetoface with the acromantulas They had been quite cl ear that Aragog was the only thing that stopped them from eating Hagrid Never bin an area o the forest I couldn go before said Hagrid shaking his head It wasn easy gettin Aragogs body out o there I can tell yeh they usually eat their dead see But I wanted ter give im a nice burial a proper sendoff He broke into sobs again and Harry resumed the patting of his elbow saying as he did so for the potion seemed to indicate that it was the right thing to do Pro fessor Slughorn met me coming down here Hagrid Not in trouble are yeh said Hagrid looking up alarmed Yeh shouldn be outta the castle in the evenin I know it its my fault No no when he heard what I was doing he said hed like to come and pay his last respects to Aragog too said Harry Hes gone to change into something more suitable I think and he said hed bring some bottles so we can drink to Aragogs memory Did he said Hagrid looking both astonished and touched AFTER THE BURIAL 483 Thas thas righ nice of him that is an not turnin yeh in either Ive never really had a lot ter do with Horace Slughorn before Comin ter see old Aragog off though eh Well hedve liked that Aragog would Harry thought privately that wh at Aragog would have liked most about Slughorn was the ample amount of edible flesh he provided but he merely moved to th e rear window of Hagrids hut where he saw the rather horrible si ght of the enormous dead spider lying on its back outside it s legs curled and tangled Are we going to bury him here Hagrid in your garden Jus beyond the pumpkin patch I thought said Hagrid in a choked voice Ive already dug the yeh know grave Jus thought wed say a few nice thin gs over him happy memories yeh know His voice quivered and broke There was a knock on the door and he turned to answer it blowing his nose on his great spotted handkerchief as he did so Slughorn hurried over the threshold several bottles in his arms and wearing a somber black cravat Hagrid he said in a deep gr ave voice So very sorry to hear of your loss Thas very nice of yeh said Hagrid Thanks a lot An thanks fer not givin Harry dete ntion neither Wouldnt have dreamed of it said Slughorn Sad night sad night Where is the poor creature Out here said Hagrid in a sh aking voice Shall we shall we do it then The three of them stepped out in to the back garden The moon was glistening palely through the trees now and its rays mingled CHAPTER TWENTYTWO 484 with the light spilling from Hagrids window to illuminate Aragogs body lying on the edge of a ma ssive pit beside a tenfoothigh mound of freshly dug earth Magnificent said Slughorn approaching the spiders head where eight milky eyes stared bl ankly at the sk y and two huge curved pincers shone motionless in the moonlight Harry thought he heard the tinkle of bottles as Slughorn bent over the pincers apparently examining the enormous hairy head Its not evryone appreciates how beauiful they are said Hagrid to Slughorns back tears leaking from the corners of his crinkled eyes I didn know yeh we re intrested in creatures like Aragog Horace Interested My dear Hagrid I revere them said Slughorn stepping back from the body Harr y saw the glint of a bottle disappear beneath his cloak though Hagrid mopping his eyes once more noticed nothing Now shall we proceed to the burial Hagrid nodded and moved forward He heaved the gigantic spider into his arms and with an en ormous grunt rolled it into the dark pit It hit the bottom with a rather horrible crunchy thud Hagrid started to cry again Of course its difficult for you who knew him best said Slughorn who like Harry could reac h no higher than Hagrids elbow but patted it all the same Why dont I say a few words He must have got a lot of g ood quality venom from Aragog Harry thought for Slughorn wore a satisfied smirk as he stepped up to the rim of the pit and said in a slow impressive voice Farewell Aragog king of arachnids whose long and faithful friendship those who knew you wont forget Though your body will decay your AFTER THE BURIAL 485 spirit lingers on in the quiet webspun places of your forest home May your manyeyed descendants ever flourish and your human friends find solace for the loss they have sustained Tha was tha was beauiful howled Hagrid and he collapsed onto the compost heap crying harder than ever There there said Slughorn wavi ng his wand so that the huge pile of earth rose up and then fel l with a muffled sort of crash onto the dead spider forming a smooth mound Lets get inside and have a drink Get on his other side Harry Thats it Up you come Hagrid Well done They deposited Hagrid in a chai r at the table Fang who had been skulking in his basket duri ng the burial now came padding softly across to them and put his heavy head into Harrys lap as usual Slughorn uncorked one of the bottles of wine he had brought I have had it all tested for poison he assured Harry pouring most of the first bottle into one of Hagrids bucketsized mugs and handing it to Hagrid Had a house elf taste every bottle after what happened to your poor friend Rupert Harry saw in his minds eye th e expression on Hermiones face if she ever heard about this abuse of houseelves and decided never to mention it to her One for Harry said Slughorn dividing a second bottle between two mugs and one for me Well he raised his mug high to Aragog Aragog said Harry and Hagrid together Both Slughorn and Hagrid drank deeply Harry however with the way ahead illuminated for him by Felix Felicis knew that he CHAPTER TWENTYTWO 486 must not drink so he merely pret ended to take a gulp and then set the mug back on the table before him I had him from an egg yeh know said Hagrid morosely Tiny little thing he was when he hatched Bout the size of a Pekingese Sweet said Slughorn Used ter keep him in a cupboard up at the school until well Hagrids face darkened and Harry knew why Tom Riddle had contrived to have Hagrid thrown out of school blamed for opening the Chamber of Secrets Slugho rn however did not seem to be listening he was looking up at the ceiling from which a number of brass pots hung and also a long silky skein of bright white hair Thats never unicorn hair Hagrid Oh yeah said Hagrid indifferently Gets pulled out of their tails they catch it on branches an stuff in the forest yeh know But my dear chap do you know how much thats worth I use it fer bindin on bandages an stuff if a creature gets injured said Hagrid shrugging I ts dead useful very strong see Slughorn took another deep dr aught from his mug his eyes moving carefully around the cabin now looking Harry knew for more treasures that he might be ab le to convert into a plentiful supply of oakmatured mead crystali zed pineapple and velvet smoking jackets He refilled Hagrids mug and his own and questioned him about the creatures that lived in the forest these days and how Hagrid was able to lo ok after them all Hagrid becoming expansive under the influence of the dr ink and Slughorns flattering interest stopped mopping his eyes and entered happily into a long explanation of bowt ruckle husbandry AFTER THE BURIAL 487 The Felix Felicis gave Harry a little nudge at this point and he noticed that the supply of drink that Slughorn had brought was running out fast Harry had not yet managed to bring off the Refilling Charm without saying the incantation aloud but the idea that he might not be able to do it tonight was la ughable Indeed Harry grinned to himself as unnoti ced by either Hagrid or Slughorn now swapping tales of the illegal trade in dragon eggs he pointed his wand under the table at the emptying bottles and they immediately began to refill After an hour or so Hagrid and Slughorn began making extravagant toasts to Hogwarts to Dumbledore to elfmade wine and to H a r r y P o t t e r b e l l o w e d H a g r i d s l o p p i n g s o m e o f h i s f o u r teenth bucket of wine down his chin as he drained it Yes indeed cried Slughorn a little thickly Parry Otter the Chosen Boy Who well something of that sort he mumbled and drained his mug too Not long after this Hagrid beca me tearful again and pressed the whole unicorn tail upon Slughorn who pocketed it with cries of To friendship To generosity To ten Galleons a hair And for a while after that Hagrid and Slughorn were sitting side by side arms around each other singing a slow sad song about a dying wizard called Odo Aaargh the good die young muttered Hagrid slumping low onto the table a little crosseyed while Slughorn continued to warble the refrain Me dad was no ag e ter go nor were yer mum an dad Harry Great fat tears oozed out of the co rners of Hagrids crinkled eyes again he grasped Harry s arm and shook it CHAPTER TWENTYTWO 488 Bes wiz and witchard o their age I never knew terrible thing terribl e thing And Odo the hero they bore him back home To the place that he d known as a lad sang Slughorn plaintively They laid him to rest with his hat inside out And his wand snapped in two which was sad terrible Hagrid grunted and his great shaggy head rolled sideways onto his arms and he fell asleep snoring deeply Sorry said Slughorn with a hiccu p Cant carry a tune to save my life Hagrid wasnt talking about your singing said Harry quietly He was talking about my mum and dad dying Oh said Slughorn repressing a large belch Oh dear Yes that was was terrible indeed Te rrible terrible He looked quite at a loss for what to say and resorted to refilling their mugs I dont dont suppose you re member it Harry he asked awkwardly No well I was only one when they died said Harry his eyes on the flame of the candle fl ickering in Hagrids heavy snores But Ive found out pretty much wh at happened since My dad died first Did you know that I I didnt said Slughorn in a hushed voice Yeah Voldemort murdered him and then stepped over his body toward my mum said Harry AFTER THE BURIAL 489 Slughorn gave a great shudder but he did not seem able to tear his horrified gaze away from Harrys face He told her to get out of the way said Harry remorselessly He told me she neednt have died He only wanted me She could have run Oh dear breathed Slughorn S he could have she neednt Thats awful It is isnt it said Harry in a voice barely more than a whisper But she didnt move Dad was al ready dead but she didnt want me to go too She tried to plead with Voldemort but he just laughed Thats enough said Slughorn suddenly raising a shaking hand Really my dear boy enough Im an old man I dont need to hear I don t want to hear I forgot lied Harry Felix Fe licis leading him on You liked her didnt you Liked her said Slughorn his eyes brimming with tears once more I dont imagine anyone wh o met her wouldnt have liked her Very brave Very funny It was the most horrible thing But you wont help her son said Harry She gave me her life but you wont give me a memory Hagrids rumbling snores filled the cabin Harry looked steadily into Slughorns tearfilled eyes The Potions master seemed unable to look away Dont say that he whispered It isnt a question If it were to help you of course but no purpose can be served It can said Harry clearly D umbledore needs information I need information CHAPTER TWENTYTWO 490 He knew he was safe Felix was telling him that Slughorn would remember nothing of this in the morning Looking Slughorn straight in the eye Harry leaned forward a little I am the Chosen One I have to kill him I need that memory Slughorn turned paler than ev er his shiny forehead gleamed with sweat You are the Chosen One Of course I am said Harry calmly But then my dear boy youre asking a great deal youre asking me in fact to aid you in your attempt to destroy You dont want to get rid of th e wizard who killed Lily Evans Harry Harry of course I do but Youre scared hell find out you helped me Slughorn said nothing he looked terrified Be brave like my moth er Professor Slughorn raised a pudg y hand and pressed his shaking fingers to his mouth he looked for a moment like an enormously overgrown baby I am not proud he whispe red through his fingers I am ashamed of what of what that memory shows I think I may have done great damage that day Youd cancel out anything you did by giving me the memory said Harry It would be a very brave and noble thing to do Hagrid twitched in his sleep and snored on Slughorn and Harry stared at each other over the guttering candle There was a long long silence but Felix Felicis told Harry not to break it to wait Then very slowly Slughorn pu t his hand in his pocket and pulled out his wand He put his other hand inside his cloak and took out a small empty bottle Still looking into Harrys eyes AFTER THE BURIAL 491 Slughorn touched the tip of his wa nd to his temple and withdrew it so that a long silver thread of memory came away too clinging to the wand tip Longer and longer the memory stretched until it broke and swung silvery bright from the wand Slughorn lowered it into the bottle where it coiled then spread swirling like gas He corked the bottle with a trembl ing hand and then passed it across the table to Harry Thank you very much Professor Youre a good boy said Profe ssor Slughorn te ars trickling down his fat cheeks into his walrus mustache And youve got her eyes Just dont thin k too badly of me once youve seen it And he too put his head on his arms gave a deep sigh and fell asleep T W E N T Y T H R E E 492 HORCRUXES arry could feel the Felix Felici s wearing off as he crept back into the castle The front door had remained unlocked for him but on the third fl oor he met Peeves and only narrowly avoided detection by diving sideways through one of his shortcuts By the time he got up to the portrait of the Fat Lady and pulled off his Invisibility Cloak he was not surprised to find her in a most unhelpful mood What sort of time do you call this Im really sorry I had to go out for something important Well the password changed at mi dnight so youll just have to sleep in the corridor wont you Youre joking said Harry Why did it have to change at midnight Thats the way it is said the Fat Lady If youre angry go and take it up with the headmaster hes the one whos tightened security H HORCRUXES 493 Fantastic said Harry bitterly l ooking around at the hard floor Really brilliant Yeah I would go and take it up with Dumbledore if he was here because hes the one who wanted me to He is here said a voice be hind Harry Professor Dumbledore returned to the scho ol an hour ago Nearly Headless Nick was gliding toward Harry his head wobbling as usual upon his ruff I had it from the Bloody Baro n who saw him arrive said Nick He appeared according to th e Baron to be in good spirits though a little tire d of course Where is he said Ha rry his heart leaping Oh groaning and clanking up on the Astronomy Tower its a favorite pastime of his Not the Bloody Baron Dumbledore Oh in his office said Nick I believe from what the Baron said that he had business to at tend to before turning in Yeah he has said Harry excite ment blazing in his chest at the prospect of telling Dumbledore he had secured the memory He wheeled about and sprinted off ag ain ignoring the Fat Lady who was calling after him Come back All right I lied I was annoyed you woke me up The passwords still tapeworm But Harry was already hurtling back along the corridor and within minutes he was saying t offee clairs to Dumbledores gargoyle which leapt aside permitti ng Harry entrance onto the spiral staircase Enter said Dumbledore wh en Harry knocked He sounded exhausted Harry pushed open the door There was Dumbledores office CHAPTER TWENTYTHREE 494 looking the same as ever but with black starstrewn skies beyond the windows Good gracious Harry said Dumb ledore in surprise To what do I owe this very late pleasure Sir Ive got it Ive got the memory from Slughorn Harry pulled out the tiny glass bot tle and showed it to Dumbledore For a moment or two the headmaster looked stunned Then his face split in a wide smile Harry this is spectacular news Very well done indeed I knew you could do it All thought of the lateness of the hour apparently forgotten he hurried around his desk took the bottle with Slughorns memory in his uninjured hand and strode over to the cabinet where he kept the Pensieve And now said Dumbledore placing the stone basin upon his desk and emptying the contents of the bottle into it Now at last we shall see Harry quickly Harry bowed obediently over the P ensieve and felt his feet leave the office floor Once agai n he fell through darkness and landed in Horace Slughorns office many years before There was the much younger Slug horn with his thick shiny strawcolored hair and his gingeryblond mustache sitting again in the comfortable winged armchair in his office his feet resting upon a velvet pouffe a small glass of wine in one hand the other rummaging in a box of crystalized pi neapple And there were the halfdozen teenage boys sitting around Slughorn with Tom Riddle in the midst of them Marvolos goldandblack ring gleaming on his finger HORCRUXES 495 Dumbledore landed beside Harry just as Riddle asked Sir is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring Tom Tom if I knew I couldnt tell you said Slughorn wagging his finger reprovingly at Ri ddle though winking at the same time I must say Id like to kn ow where you get your information boy more knowledgeable than half the staff you are Riddle smiled the other boys la ughed and cast him admiring looks What with your uncanny ability to know things you shouldnt and your careful flattery of the people who matter thank you for the pineapple by the way youre quite right it is my favorite Several of the boys tittered again I confidently expect you to ri se to Minister of Magic within twenty years Fifteen if you k eep sending me pineapple I have excellent contacts at the Ministry Tom Riddle merely smiled as th e others laughed again Harry noticed that he was by no means the eldest of the group of boys but that they all seemed to look to him as their leader I dont know that politics would suit me sir he said when the laughter had died away I dont ha ve the right kind of background for one thing A couple of the boys around him smirked at each other Harry was sure they were enjoying a private joke undoubtedly about what they knew or suspected rega rding their gang leaders famous ancestor Nonsense said Slughorn briskly couldnt be plainer you come from decent Wizarding stock abilities like yours No youll go far Tom Ive never been wrong about a student yet CHAPTER TWENTYTHREE 496 The small golden clock standing upon Slughorns desk chimed eleven oclock behind hi m and he looked around Good gracious is it that time already Youd better get going boys or well all be in trouble Le strange I want your essay by tomorrow or its detention Same goes for you Avery One by one the boys filed out of the room Slughorn heaved himself out of his armchair and ca rried his empty glass over to his desk A movement behind him ma de him look around Riddle was still standing there Look sharp Tom you dont want to be caught out of bed out of hours and you a prefect Sir I wanted to ask you something Ask away then mboy ask away Sir I wondered what you know about ab out Horcruxes Slughorn stared at him his thick fingers absentmindedly caressing the stem of his wine glass Project for Defense Agains t the Dark Arts is it But Harry could tell that Slughorn knew perfectly we ll that this was not schoolwork Not exactly sir said Riddle I came across the term while reading and I didnt fully understand it No well youd be hard pushed to find a book at Hogwarts thatll give you details on Horcruxes Tom thats very Dark stuff very Dark ind eed said Slughorn But you obviously know all abou t them sir I mean a wizard like you sorry I mean if you cant tell me obviously I just knew if anyone could tell me yo u could so I ju st thought Id ask It was very well done thought Ha rry the hesitancy the casual HORCRUXES 497 tone the careful flattery none of it overdone He Harry had had too much experience of trying to wheedle information out of reluctant people not to recognize a ma ster at work He could tell that Riddle wanted the information ve ry very much perhaps had been working toward this moment for weeks Well said Slughorn not lookin g at Riddle bu t fiddling with the ribbon on top of his box of crystalized pineapple well it cant hurt to give you an overview of co urse Just so that you understand the term A Horcrux is the word us ed for an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul I dont quite understand how th at works though sir said Riddle His voice was carefully controll ed but Harry could sense his excitement Well you split your soul yo u see said Slughorn and hide part of it in an object outside th e body Then even if ones body is attacked or destroyed one cannot di e for part of the soul remains earthbound and undamaged But of course existence in such a form Slughorns face crumpled and Harry found himself remembering words he had heard nearly two years before I was ripped from my body I was less than spirit less than the meanest ghost but still I was alive few would want it Tom very few Death would be preferable But Riddles hunger was now a pparent his expression was greedy he could no longer hide his longing How do you split your soul Well said Slughorn uncomfor tably you must understand CHAPTER TWENTYTHREE 498 that the soul is supposed to remain intact and whole Splitting it is an act of violation it is against nature But how do you do it By an act of evil the supreme act of evil By committing murder Killing rips the soul apart The wizard intent upon creating a Horcrux would use the damage to his advantage He would encase the torn portion Encase But how There is a spell do not ask me I dont know said Slughorn shaking his head like an old elep hant bothered by mosquitoes Do I look as though I have tried it do I look li ke a killer No sir of course not said Riddle quickly Im sorry I didnt mean to offend Not at all not at al l not offended said Slughorn gruffly Its natural to feel some curiosity abou t these things Wizards of a certain caliber have always be en drawn to that aspect of magic Yes sir said Riddle What I dont understand though just out of curiosity I mean would one Horcrux be much use Can you only split your soul once Wo u l d n t i t b e b e t t e r m a k e y o u stronger to have your soul in more pieces I mean for instance isnt seven the most powerfully magica l number wouldnt seven Merlins beard Tom yelped Slughorn Seven Isnt it bad enough to think of killing one pe rson And in any case bad enough to divide the soul but to rip it in to seven pieces Slughorn looked deeply troubled now He was gazing at Riddle as though he had never seen him plainly before and Harry could tell that he was regre tting entering into the conversation at all HORCRUXES 499 Of course he muttered this is all hypothetical what were discussing isnt it All academic Yes sir of course said Riddle quickly But all the same Tom keep it quiet what Ive told thats to say what weve discussed Peop le wouldnt like to think weve been chatting about Horcruxes It s a banned subject at Hogwarts you know Dumbledores partic ularly fierce ab out it I wont say a word sir said Ri ddle and he left but not before Harry had glimpsed his face which was full of that same wild happiness it had worn when he had fi rst found out that he was a wizard the sort of happiness that did not enhance his handsome features but made them so mehow less human Thank you Harry said Dumbledo re quietly Let us go When Harry landed back on the office floor Dumbledore was already sitting down behind his de sk Harry sat too and waited for Dumbledore to speak I have been hoping for this piece of evidence for a very long time said Dumbledore at last It confirms the theory on which I have been working it tells me that I am right and also how very far there is still to go Harry suddenly noticed that every single one of the old headmasters and headmistresses in the portraits around the walls was awake and listening in on their conversation A corpulent rednosed wizard had actually taken out an ear trumpet Well Harry said Dumbledore I am sure you understood the significance of what we just heard At the same age as you are now give or take a few months Tom Riddle was doing all he could to find out how to make himself immortal CHAPTER TWENTYTHREE 500 You think he succeeded then sir asked Harry He made a Horcrux And thats why he didn t die when he attacked me He had a Horcrux hidden somewhere A bit of his soul was safe A bit or more said Du mbledore You heard Voldemort What he particularly wanted from Horace was an opinion on what would happen to the wizard who cr eated more than one Horcrux what would happen to the wizard so determined to evade death that he would be prepared to murder many times rip his soul repeatedly so as to store it in ma ny separately concealed Horcruxes No book would have given him th at information As far as I k n o w a s f a r I a m s u r e a s V o l d e m o r t k n e w n o w i z a r d h a d ever done more than tear his soul in two Dumbledore paused for a moment marshaling his thoughts and then said Four years ago I re ceived what I considered certain proof that Voldemort had split his soul Where asked Harry How You handed it to me Harry said Dumbledore The diary Riddles diary the one giving instructions on how to reopen the Chamber of Secrets I dont understand sir said Harry Well although I did not see the Riddle who came out of the diary what you described to me was a phenomenon I had never witnessed A mere memory starting to act and think for itself A mere memory sapping the life out of the girl into whose hands it had fallen No something much more sinister had live d inside that book a fragment of soul I wa s almost sure of it The diary had been a Horcrux But this raised as many questions as it answered What intrigued and alarmed me most was that that diary had been intended as a weapon as much as a safeguard HORCRUXES 501 I still dont understand said Harry Well it worked as a Horcrux is supposed to work in other words the fragment of soul conc ealed inside it was kept safe and had undoubtedly played its part in preventing the death of its owner But there could be no doubt that Riddle really wanted that diary read wanted the piece of hi s soul to inhabit or possess somebody else so that Sl ytherins monster would be unleashed again Well he didnt want his hard work to be wasted said Harry He wanted people to know he was Slytherins heir because he couldnt take cred it at the time Quite correct said Dumbledore nodding But dont you see Harry that if he intended the dia ry to be passed to or planted on some future Hogwarts student he was being remarkably blas about that precious fragment of his soul concealed within it The point of a Horcrux is as Professor Slughorn explained to keep part of the self hidden and safe not to fl ing it into somebody elses path and run the risk that they might destroy it as indeed happened That particular fragment of soul is no more you saw to that The careless way in which Voldemort regarded this Horcrux seemed most ominous to me It suggested that he must have made or been planning to make more Horcruxes so that the loss of his first would not be so de trimental I did not wish to believe it but nothing else seemed to make sense Then you told me two years later that on the night that Voldemort returned to his body he ma de a most illuminating and alarming statement to his Death Eaters I who have gone further than anybody along the path that leads to immortality That was what you told me he said Further than anybody And I thought I knew what that meant though the Death Eaters did not He was referring to CHAPTER TWENTYTHREE 502 his Horcruxes Horcruxes in the plural Harry which I do not believe any other wizard has ever ha d Yet it fitted Lord Voldemort has seemed to grow less human with the passing years and the transformation he has undergone s eemed to me to be only explicable if his soul was mutilated beyond the realms of what we might call usual evil So hes made himself impossible to kill by murdering other people said Harry Why couldnt he make a Sorcerers Stone or steal one if he was so interested in immortality Well we know that he tried to do just that five years ago said Dumbledore But there are several reasons why I think a Sorcerers Stone would appe al less than Horcruxes to Lord Voldemort While the Elixir of Life does in deed extend life it must be drunk regularly for all eternity if the drinker is to maintain their immortality Therefore Voldemor t would be entirely dependent on the Elixir and if it ran out or was contaminated or if the Stone was stolen he would die just like any other man Voldemort likes to operate alone remember I beli eve that he woul d have found the thought of being dependent even on the Elixir intolerable Of course he was prepared to drink it if it would take him out of the horrible partlife to which he wa s condemned after attacking you but only to regain a body Thereafter I am convinced he intended t o c o n t i n u e t o r e l y o n h i s H o r c r u x e s H e w o u l d n e e d n o t h i n g more if only he could regain a human form He was already immortal you see or as close to immortal as any man can be But now Harry armed with this information the crucial memory you have succeeded in procuring for us we are closer to the secret of finishing Lord Voldemort than anyone has ever been before You heard him Harry Wouldnt it be better make you stronger HORCRUXES 503 to have your soul in more pieces isnt seven the most powerfully magical number Isnt seven the most powerfully magical number Yes I think the idea of a sevenpart soul would greatly appeal to Lord Voldemort He made seven Horcruxes said Harry horrorstruck while several of the portraits on the wa lls made similar noises of shock and outrage But they could be anywhere in the world hidden buried or invisible I am glad to see you appreciate the magnitude of the problem said Dumbledore calmly But fi rstly no Harry not seven Horcruxes six The seventh part of his soul however maimed resides inside his regenerated body That was the part of him that lived a spectral existence for so many year s during his exile without that he has no self at all That seve nth piece of soul will be the last that anybody wishing to kill Voldemort must attack the piece that lives in his body But the six Horcruxes then said Harry a little desperately how are we suppose d to find them You are forgetting you have already destroyed one of them And I have destroyed another You have said Harry eagerly Yes indeed said Dumbledore and he raised his blackened burnedlooking hand The ring Harry Marvolos ring And a terrible curse there was upon it too Had it not been forgive me the lack of seemly modesty for my own prodigious skill and for Professor Snapes timely action when I returned to Hogwarts desperately injured I might not have lived to tell the tale However a withered hand does not seem an unreasonable exchange for a seventh of Voldemorts soul The ri ng is no longer a Horcrux CHAPTER TWENTYTHREE 504 But how did you find it Well as you now know for many years I have made it my business to discover as much as I can about Voldemorts past life I have traveled widely visiting those pl aces he once knew I stumbled across the ring hidden in the ruin of the Gaunts house It seems that once Voldemort had succeeded in sealing a piece of his soul inside it he did not want to wear it anymore He hid it protected by many powerful enchantments in the shack where his ancestors had once lived Morfin having been cart ed off to Azkaban of course never guessing that I might one da y take the trouble to visit the ruin or that I might be keeping an eye open for traces of magical concealment However we should not congratulate ourselves too heartily You destroyed the diary and I the ring but if we are right in our theory of a sevenpart soul four Horcruxes remain And they could be anything said Harry They could be old tin cans or I dunno empty potion bottles You are thinking of Portkeys Harry which must be ordinary objects easy to overlook But woul d Lord Voldemort use tin cans or old potion bottles to guard his own precious soul You are forgetting what I have showed you Lord Voldemort liked to collect trophies and he preferred objects with a powerful magical history His pride his belief in his own su periority his determination to carve for himself a startling place in magical history these things suggest to me that Voldemort would have chosen his Horcruxes with some care favoring ob jects worthy of the honor The diary wasnt that special The diary as you have said yourself was proof that he was the HORCRUXES 505 Heir of Slytherin I am sure that Voldemort considered it of stupendous importance So the other Horcruxes said Harry Do you think you know what they are sir I can only guess said Dumbledore For the reasons I have already given I believe that Lord Voldemort would prefer objects that in themselves have a cert ain grandeur I have therefore trawled back through Voldemorts pa st to see if I can find evidence that such artifacts have disappeared around him The locket said Harry loudly Hufflepuffs cup Yes said Dumbledore smiling I would be prepared to bet perhaps not my other hand but a co uple of fingers that they became Horcruxes three and four The remaining two assuming again that he created a total of six are more of a problem but I will hazard a guess that having secu red objects from Hufflepuff and Slytherin he set out to track dow n objects owned by Gryffindor or Ravenclaw Four objects from the four founders would I am sure have exerted a powerful pull over Voldemorts imagination I cannot answer for whether he ever managed to find anything of Ravenclaws I am confident howeve r that the only known relic of Gryffindor remains safe Dumbledore pointed his blackened fingers to the wall behind him where a rubyencrusted swor d reposed within a glass case Do you think thats why he really wanted to come back to Hogwarts sir said Harry To try an d find something from one of the other founders My thoughts precisely said Dumbledore But unfortunately that does not advance us much furthe r for he was turned away or CHAPTER TWENTYTHREE 506 so I believe without the chance to search the school I am forced to conclude that he never fulfilled his ambition of collecting four founders objects He definitely had two he may have found three that is the best we can do for now Even if he got something of Rave nclaws or of Gryffindors that leaves a sixth Horcrux said Harr y counting on his fingers Unless he got both I dont think so said Dumbledore I think I know what the sixth Horcrux is I wonder what you wi ll say when I confess that I have been curious for a while about the behavior of the snake Nagini The snake said Harry startl ed You can use animals as Horcruxes Well it is inadvisa ble to do so said Dumbledore because to confide a part of your soul to something that can think and move for itself is obviously a very risky business However if my calculations are correct Voldemort was still at least one Horcrux short of his goal of six when he entered yo ur parents house with the intention of killing you He seems to have reserved the process of making Horcruxes for particularly significant deaths Yo u would certainly have been that He believed that in killing you he was destroying the danger the prophecy had outlined He believ ed he was making himself invincible I am sure that he was in tending to make his final Horcrux with your death As we know he failed After an interval of some years however he used Nagini to kill an old Mu ggle man and it might then have occurred to him to turn her into his last Horcrux She underlines the Slytherin connection which en hances Lord Voldemorts mystique I think he is perhaps as fond of her as he can be of anything HORCRUXES 507 he certainly likes to keep her clos e and he seems to have an unusual amount of control over her even for a Parselmouth So said Harry the diarys gone the rings gone The cup the locket and the snake are still inta ct and you think there might be a Horcrux that was once Ravenclaws or Gryffindors An admirably succinct and accu rate summary yes said Dumbledore bowing his head So are you still looking for them sir Is that where youve been going when youve been leaving the school Correct said Dumbledore I ha ve been looking for a very long time I think perhaps I may be close to finding another one There ar e hopeful signs And if you do said Harry quic kly can I come with you and help get rid of it Dumbledore looked at Harry very intently for a moment before saying Yes I think so I can said Harry thoroughly taken aback Oh yes said Dumbledore smiling slightly I think you have earned that right Harry felt his heart lift It was very good not to hear words of caution and protection for on ce The headmasters and headmistresses around the walls seemed less impressed by Dumbledores decision Harry saw a few of them shaking their heads and Phineas Nigellus actually snorted Does Voldemort know when a Ho rcrux is destroyed sir Can he feel it Harry asked ignoring the portraits A very interesting question Harry I believe not I believe that Voldemort is now so immersed in evil and these crucial parts of himself have been detached for so long he does not feel as we do CHAPTER TWENTYTHREE 508 Perhaps at the point of death he might be aware of his loss but he was not aware for instance th at the diary had been destroyed until he forced the truth out of Lucius Malfoy When Voldemort discovered that the diary had been mutilated and robbed of all its powers I am told that his an ger was terrible to behold But I thought he meant Lucius Malfoy to smuggle it into Hogwarts Yes he did years ago when he was sure he would be able to create more Horcruxes but still Lucius was supposed to wait for Voldemorts sayso and he never received it for Voldemort vanished shortly after gi ving him the diary No doubt he thought that Luci us would not dare do anything with the Horcrux other than guard it carefully but he was counting too much upon Luciuss fear of a master who had been gone for years and whom Lucius believed dead Of course Lucius did not know what the diary really was I unders tand that Voldemort had told him the diary would cause the Chamber of Secrets to reopen because it was cleverly enchanted Had Lucius known he held a portion of his masters soul in his hands he would undoubtedly have treated it with more reverence but instead he went ahead and carried out the old plan for his own ends By planting the diary upon Arthur Weasleys daughter he hoped to discredit Arthur and get rid of a highly incriminating magical object in one stroke Ah poor Lucius what with Voldemorts fury about th e fact that he threw aw ay the Horcrux for his own gain and the fiasco at the Mini stry last year I would not be surprised if he is not secretly glad to be safe in Azkaban at the moment Harry sat in thought for a moment then asked So if all of his Horcruxes are destroyed Voldemort could be killed Yes I think so said Dumbledore Without his Horcruxes HORCRUXES 509 Voldemort will be a mortal man with a maimed and diminished soul Never forget though that w hile his soul may be damaged beyond repair his brain and his magica l powers remain intact It will take uncommon skill and power to kill a wizard like Voldemort even without his Horcruxes But I havent got uncommon skill and power said Harry before he could stop himself Yes you have said Dumbledore firmly You have a power that Voldemort has never had You can I know said Harry impatiently I can love It was only with difficulty that he stopped himself a dding Big deal Yes Harry you can love said Dumbledore who looked as though he knew perfectly well wh at Harry had just refrained from saying Which given everything th at has happened to you is a great and remarkable thing You ar e still too young to understand how unusual you are Harry So when the prophecy says that Ill have power the Dark Lord knows not it just means love asked Harry feeling a little let down Yes just love said Dumble dore But Harry never forget that what the prophecy says is only significant because Voldemort made it so I told you this at the end of last year Voldemort singled you out as the person who woul d be most dangerous to him and in doing so he made you the person who would be most dangerous to him But it comes to the same No it doesnt said Dumbledore sounding impatient now Pointing at Harry with his black withered hand he said You are setting too much stor e by the prophecy CHAPTER TWENTYTHREE 510 But spluttered Harry but you said the prop hecy means If Voldemort had never heard of the prophecy would it have been fulfilled Would it have mean t anything Of course not Do you think every prophecy in the Hall of Prophecy has been fulfilled But said Harry bewildered but last year you said one of us would have to kill the other Harry Harry only because Vold emort made a grave error and acted on Professor Trelawneys words If Voldemort had never murdered your father would he have imparted in you a furious desire for revenge Of course not If he had not forced your mother to die for you would he have given you a magical protecti on he could not penetrate Of course not Harry Dont you see Voldemort himself created his worst enemy just as tyrants everywhere do Have you any idea how much tyrants fear th e people they oppress All of them realize that one day amongs t their many victims there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back Voldemort is no different Always he was on the lookout for the one who would challenge him He heard the prophecy and he leapt into action with the result that he no t only handpicked the man most likely to finish him he handed him uniquely deadly weapons But It is essential that you understand this said Dumbledore standing up and striding about the room his glittering robes swooshing in his wake Harry had never seen him so agitated By attempting to kill you Voldemor t himself singled out the remarkable person who sits here in fron t of me and gave him the tools for the job It is Voldemorts fault th at you were able to see into his thoughts his ambitions that yo u even understand the snakelike HORCRUXES 511 language in which he gives orde rs and yet Harry despite your privileged insight into Voldemort s world which incidentally is a gift any Death Eater would kill to have you have never been seduced by the Dark Arts never even for a second shown the slightest desire to become one of Voldemort s followers Of course I havent said Ha rry indignantly He killed my mum and dad You are protected in short by your ability to love said Dumbledore loudly The only protection that can possibly work against the lure of power like Voldemorts In spite of all the temptation you have endured all the suffering you remain pure of heart just as pure as you were at the age of eleven when you stared into a mirror that reflected your hearts de sire and it showed you only the way to thwart Lord Voldemort and not immortality or riches Harry have you any idea how fe w wizards could have seen what you saw in that mirror Voldemor t should have known then what he was dealing with but he did not But he knows it now You have flitted into Lord Voldemorts mind without damage to yourself but he cannot possess you without enduring mortal agony as he discovered in the Ministry I do not think he understands why Ha rry but then he was in such a hurry to mutilate his own soul he never paused to understand the incomparable power of a soul th at is untarnished and whole But sir said Harry making va liant efforts not to sound argumentative it all comes to the same thing doesnt it Ive got to try and kill him or Got to said Dumbledore Of course youve got to But not because of the prophecy Because you yourself will never rest until youve tried We both know it Im agine please just for a moment CHAPTER TWENTYTHREE 512 that you had never heard that pr ophecy How would you feel about Voldemort now Think Harry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in front of him and thought He thought of hi s mother his father and Sirius He thought of Cedric Diggory He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done A flame seemed to leap inside his chest sear ing his throat Id want him finished said Ha rry quietly And Id want to do it Of course you would cried Dumbledore You see the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything But the prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to mark you as his equal In other words you are free to choose your way quite free to turn your back on the prophecy But Voldemort continue s to set store by the prophecy He will continue to hunt you which makes it certain really that That one of us is going to end up killing the other said Harry Yes But he understood at last what Dumbledore had been trying to tell him It was he thought the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high Some people perhaps would say that there was little to choose between the two ways but Dumbledore knew and so do I thought Harry with a rush of fierce pride and so did my parents that there was al l the difference in the world T W E N T Y F O U R 513 SECTU MSEMPRA xhausted but delighted with his nights work Harry told Ron and Hermione everything that had happ ened during next mornings Charms lesson having first cast the Muffliato spell upon those nearest them They we re both satisfyingly impressed by the way he had wheedled the memory out of Slughorn and positively awed when he told them about Voldemorts Horcruxes and Dumbledores promise to take Harry along should he find another one Wow said Ron when Harry ha d finally finished telling them everything Ron was waving his wa nd very vaguely in the direction of the ceiling without paying the slightest bit of attention to what he was doing Wow Youre actual ly going to go with Dumbledore and try and de stroy wow Ron youre making it snow said Hermione patiently grabbing his wrist and redirecting his wand away from the ceiling from which sure enough large white flak es had started to fall Lavender E CHAPTER TWENTYFOUR 514 Brown Harry noticed glared at Hermione from a neighboring table through very red eyes and He rmione immediately let go of Rons arm Oh yeah said Ron looking do wn at his shoulders in vague surprise Sorry looks like weve all got horrible dandruff now He brushed some of the fake snow off Hermiones shoulder Lavender burst into tears Ron l ooked immensely guilty and turned his back on her We split up he told Harry out of the corner of his mouth Last night When she saw me coming out of the dormitory with Hermione Obviously she couldnt see you so she thought it had just been the two of us Ah said Harry Well you dont mind its over do you No Ron admitted It was pre tty bad while she was yelling but at least I didnt have to finish it Coward said Hermione though she looked amused Well it was a bad night for romance all ar ound Ginny and Dean split up too Harry Harry thought there was a rather knowing look in her eye as she told him that but she could not possibly know that his insides were suddenly dancing the conga Keeping his face as immobile and his voice as indifferent as he could he aske d How come Oh something really silly Sh e said he was always trying to help her through the portrait hole like she couldnt climb in herself but theyve been a bit rocky for ages Harry glanced over at Dean on th e other side of the classroom He certainly looked unhappy SECTUMSEMPRA 515 Of course this puts you in a bit of a dilemma doesnt it said Hermione What dyou mean sa id Harry quickly The Quidditch team said Hermione If Ginny and Dean arent speaking Oh oh yeah said Harry Flitwick said Ron in a warnin g tone The tiny little Charms master was bobbing his way towa rd them and Hermione was the only one who had managed to turn vinegar into wine her glass flask was full of deep crimson li quid whereas the contents of Harrys and Rons were still murky brown Now now boys squeaked Professor Flitwick reproachfully A little less talk a little more action Let me see you try Together they raised their wand s concentrating with all their might and pointed them at their flasks Harrys vinegar turned to ice Rons flask exploded Yes for homework said Professor Flitwick reemerging from under the table and pulling shards of glass out of the top of his hat practice They had one of their rare joint free periods after Charms and walked back to the common room together Ron seemed to be positively lighthearted about the end of his relationship with Lavender and Hermione seemed cheery too though when asked what she was grinning about sh e simply said Its a nice day Neither of them seemed to have noticed that a fierce battle was raging inside Harrys brain Shes Rons sister But shes ditched Dean CHAPTER TWENTYFOUR 516 Shes still Rons sister Im his best mate Thatll make it worse If I talked to him first Hed hit you What if I dont care Hes your best mate Harry barely noticed that they were climbing through the portrait hole into the sunny common room and only vaguely registered the small group of seventh years clustered to gether there until Hermione cried Katie Youre back Are you okay Harry stared It was indeed Ka tie Bell looking completely healthy and surrounded by her jubilant friends Im really well she said ha ppily They let me out of St Mungos on Monday I had a couple of days at home with Mum and Dad and then came back here this morning Leanne was just telling me about McLaggen and th e last match Harry Yeah said Harry well now yo ure back and Rons fit well have a decent chance of thrash ing Ravenclaw which means we could still be in the running fo r the Cup Listen Katie He had to put the question to her at once his curiosity even drove Ginny temporarily from his brain He dropped his voice as Katies friends started gathering up their things apparently they were late for Tr ansfiguration that necklace can you remember who gave it to you now No said Katie shaking her head ruefully Everyones been asking me but I havent got a clue The last thing I remember was walking into the ladies in the Three Broomsticks You definitely went into the bathroom then said Hermione SECTUMSEMPRA 517 Well I know I pushed open the door said Katie so I suppose whoever Imperiused me was standing just behind it After that my memorys a blank until about two w eeks ago in St Mungos Listen Id better go I wouldnt put it past McGonagall to give me lines even if it is my first day back She caught up her ba g and books and hurrie d after her friends leaving Harry Ron and Hermione to sit down at a window table and ponder what she had told them So it must have been a girl or a woman who gave Katie the necklace said Hermione to be in the ladies bathroom Or someone who looked like a girl or a woman said Harry Dont forget there was a cauldron full of Polyjuice Potion at Hogwarts We know some of it got stolen In his minds eye he watched a parade of Crabbes and Goyles prance past all transformed into girls I think Im going to take another swig of Felix said Harry and have a go at the R oom of Requirement again That would be a complete waste of potion said Hermione flatly putting down the copy of Spellmans Syllabary she had just taken out of her bag Luck can only get you so far Harry The situation with Slughorn was different you always had the ability to persuade him you just needed to tweak the circumstances a bit Luck isnt enough to get you th rough a powerful enchantment though Dont go wasting the rest of that potion Youll need all the luck you can get if Dumbledore takes you along with him She dropped her voice to a whisper Couldnt we make some more Ron asked Harry ignoring Hermione Itd be great to have a stock of it Have a look in the book CHAPTER TWENTYFOUR 518 Harry pulled his copy of Advanced PotionMaking out of his bag and looked up Felix Felicis Blimey its seriously complicated he said running an eye down the list of ingredients And it takes six months Youve got to let it stew Typical said Ron Harry was about to put his book away again when he noticed the corner of a page folded dow n turning to it he saw the Sectumsempra spell captioned For Enemies that he had marked a few weeks previously He had still not found out what it did mainly because he did not want to test it around Hermione but he was considering trying it out on Mc Laggen next time he came up behind him unawares The only person who was not particularly pleased to see Katie Bell back at school was Dean Thom as because he would no longer be required to fill her place as Chaser He took th e blow stoically enough when Harry told him merely grunting and shrugging but Harry had the distinct feeling as he walked away that Dean and Seamus were muttering muti nously behind his back The following fortnight saw the best Quidditch practices Harry had known as Captain His team was so pleased to be rid of McLaggen so glad to ha ve Katie back at last that they were flying extremely well Ginny did not seem at all upset about the breakup with Dean on the contrary she was the life and soul of the team Her imitations of Ron anxiously bobbing up and down in front of the goal posts as the Quaffle sped toward him or of Harry bellowing orders at McLaggen before being knocke d out cold kept them all highly amused Harry laughing with the others was glad to have an SECTUMSEMPRA 519 i n n o c e n t r e a s o n t o l o o k a t G i n n y h e h a d r e c e i v e d s e v e r a l m o r e Bludger injuries during practice because he had not been keeping his eyes on the Snitch The battle still raged inside his head Ginny or Ron Sometimes he thought that the postLavender Ron might not mind too much if he asked Ginny out but then he remembered Rons expression when he had seen her kissing Dean and was sure that Ron would consider it base treachery if Harry so much as held her hand Yet Harry could not help himself talking to Ginny laughing with her walking back from prac tice with her however much his conscience ached he found himself wondering how best to get her on her own It would have been ideal if Slughorn had given another of his little parties for Ron wo uld not be around but unfortunately Slughorn seemed to have given them up Once or twice Harry considered asking for Hermio nes help but he did not think he could stand seeing the smug l ook on her face he thought he caught it sometimes when Hermione spotted him staring at Ginny or laughing at her jokes And to complicate matters he had the nagging worry that if he didnt do it somebody else was sure to ask Ginny out soon He and Ron were at least agreed on the fact that she was too popular for her own good All in all the temptation to take another gulp of Felix Felicis was becoming stronger by the day for surely this was a case for as Hermione put it tweaking the circum stances The balmy days slid gently through May and Ron seemed to be there at Harrys shoulder every time he saw Ginny Ha rry found himself longing for a stroke of luck that would somehow cause Ron to realize that nothing would make him happier than his best friend and his sister falling for each other and to leav e them alone together for longer CHAPTER TWENTYFOUR 520 than a few seconds There seemed no chance of either while the final Quidditch game of the season was looming Ron wanted to talk tactics with Harry all the time an d had little thou ght for anything else Ron was not unique in this respect interest in the GryffindorRavenclaw game was running extremely high throughout the school for the match would deci de the Championship which was still wide open If Gryffindor beat Ravenclaw by a margin of three hundred points a tall order and yet Harry had never known his team to fly better then they woul d win the Championship If they won by less than three hundred po ints they would come second to Ravenclaw if they lost by a hund red points they would be third behind Hufflepuff and if they lost by more than a hundred they would be in fourth place and no body Harry thought would ever ever let him forget that it had been he who had captained Gryffindor to their first bottomofthe table defeat in two centuries The runup to this crucial ma tch had all the usual features members of rival Houses attempting to intimidate opposing teams in the corridors unpleasant chan ts about individual players being rehearsed loudly as they passed the team members themselves either swaggering around enjoying al l the attention or else dashing into bathrooms between classes to throw up Somehow the game had become inextricably linked in Harrys mind with success or failure in his plans for Ginny He co uld not help feeling that if they won by more than three hundred points the scenes of euphoria and a nice loud aftermatch party might be just as good as a hearty swig of Felix Felicis In the midst of all his preoccupa tions Harry had not forgotten his other ambition finding out wh a t M a l f o y w a s u p t o i n t h e SECTUMSEMPRA 521 Room of Requirement He was stil l checking the Marauders Map and as he was unable to locate Ma lfoy on it deduced that Malfoy was still spending plenty of time within the room Although Harry was losing hope that he would ev er succeed in getting inside the Room of Requirement he attemp ted it whenever he was in the vicinity but no matter how he re worded his request the wall remained firmly doorless A few days before the match ag ainst Ravenclaw Harry found himself walking down to dinner alone from the common room Ron having rushed off into a nea rby bathroom to throw up yet again and Hermione having dashed off to see Professor Vector about a mistake she thought she migh t have made in her last Arithmancy essay More out of habit than anything Harry made his usual detour along the seventhfloor corridor checking the Marauders Map as he went For a moment he could not find Malfoy anywhere and assumed he must indeed be inside the Room of Requirement again but then he saw Malfoys tiny labeled dot standing in a boys bathroom on the floor below accompanied not by Crabbe or Goyle but by Moaning Myrtle Harry only stopped staring at th is unlikely coupling when he walked right into a suit of armo r The loud crash brought him out of his reverie hurrying from the sc ene lest Filch turn up he dashed down the marble staircase and along the passageway below Outside the bathroom he pressed his ear agai nst the door He could not hear anything He very qu ietly pushed the door open Draco Malfoy was standing with his back to the door his hands clutching either side of the sink his whit eblond head bowed Dont crooned Moaning Myrtles voice from one of the cubicles Dont tell me whats wrong I can help you CHAPTER TWENTYFOUR 522 No one can help me said Ma lfoy His whole body was shaking I cant do it I cant It wont work and unless I do it soon he says hell kill me And Harry realized with a shock so huge it seemed to root him to the spot that Malfoy was crying actually crying tears streaming down his pale face into the grimy basin Malfoy gasped and gulped and then with a great shudder looked up into the cracked mirror and sa w Harry staring at hi m over his shoulder Malfoy wheeled around drawing his wand Instinctively Harry pulled out his own Malfoys hex missed Harry by inches shattering the lamp on the wall beside him Harry threw himself sideways thought Levicorpus and flicked his wand but Malfoy blocked the jinx and raised his wand for another No No Stop it squealed Mo aning Myrtle her voice echoing loudly around the tile d room Stop STOP There was a loud bang and the bin behind Harry exploded Harry attempted a LegLocker Curse that backfired off the wall behind Malfoys ear and smashed th e cistern beneath Moaning Myrtle who screamed loudly wate r poured everywhere and Harry slipped as Malfoy his fa ce contorted cried Cruci SECTUMSEMPRA bellowed Harry from the floor waving his wand wildly Blood spurted from Malfoys face and chest as though he had been slashed with an invisible sword He staggered backward and collapsed onto the waterlogged floo r with a great splash his wand falling from his limp right hand No gasped Harry Slipping and staggering Harry got to his feet and plunged SECTUMSEMPRA 523 toward Malfoy whose face was now shining scarlet his white hands scrabbling at his bloodsoaked chest No I didnt Harry did not know what he was sa ying he fell to his knees beside Malfoy who was shaking uncont rollably in a pool of his own blood Moaning Myrtle let out a deafening scream MURDER MURDER IN THE BATHROOM MURDER The door banged open behind Harry and he looked up terrified Snape had burst into the r oom his face livid Pushing Harry roughly aside he knelt over Malf oy drew his wand and traced it over the deep wounds Harrys cu rse had made muttering an incantation that sounded almost like song The flow of blood seemed to ease Snape wiped the residue fr om Malfoys face and repeated his spell Now the wounds seemed to be knitting Harry was still watching horrified by what he had done barely aware that he too was soaked in blood and water Moaning Myrtle was still sobbing and wailing overhead When Snape had performed his countercurse for the third time he halflifted Malfoy into a standing position You need the hospital wing Th ere may be a certain amount of scarring but if you take dittany immediately we mi ght avoid even that Come He supported Malfoy across the bathroom turning at the door to say in a voice of cold fury And you Potter You wait here for me It did not occur to Harry for a second to disobey He stood up slowly shaking and looked dow n at the wet floor There were bloodstains floating like crimson flowers across its surface He CHAPTER TWENTYFOUR 524 could not even find it in himsel f to tell Moaning Myrtle to be quiet as she continued to wail and sob with increasingly evident enjoyment Snape returned ten minutes later He stepped into the bathroom and closed the door behind him Go he said to Myrtle and she swooped back into her toilet at once leaving a ringing silence behind her I didnt mean it to happen said Harry at once His voice echoed in the cold watery space I didnt know what that spell did But Snape ignored this Apparently I underestimated you Potter he said quietly Who wo uld have thought you knew such Dark Magic Who taug ht you that spell I read about it somewhere Where It was a library b ook Harry invented wildly I cant remember what it was call Liar said Snape Harrys throat went dry He knew what Snape was going to do and he had never been able to prevent it The bathroom seemed to shimmer before his eyes he struggled to block out all thou ght but try as he might the HalfBlood Princes copy of Advanced PotionMaking swam hazily to the forefront of his mind And then he was staring at Snape again in the midst of this wrecked soaked bathroom He stared into Snapes black eyes hoping against hope that Snape had not seen wh at he feared but Bring me your schoolbag said Snape softly and all of your schoolbooks All of them Bring them to me here Now There was no point arguing Harr y turned at once and splashed SECTUMSEMPRA 525 out of the bathroom Once in the corridor he broke into a run toward Gryffindor Tower Most people were walking the other way they gaped at him drenched in water and blood but he answered none of the questions fire d at him as he ran past He felt stunned it was as thou gh a beloved pet had turned sudd e n l y s a v a g e w h a t h a d t h e P r i n c e b e e n t h i n k i n g t o c o p y s u c h a spell into his book And what would happen when Snape saw it Would he tell Slughorn Harrys stomach churned how Harry had been achieving such good results in Potions all year Would he confiscate or destroy th e book that had taught Harry so much the book th at had become a kind of guide and friend Harry could not let it happen He could not Whereve you Why are you soaking Is that blood Ron was standing at the top of th e stairs looking bewildered at the sight of Harry I need your book Harry panted Your Potions book Quick give it to me But what about the HalfBlood Ill explain later Ron pulled his copy of Advanced PotionMaking out of his bag and handed it over Harry sprinted off past him and back to the common room Here he seized his schoolbag ignoring the amazed looks of several people who had al ready finished their dinner threw himself back out of the portrait hole and hurtled off along the seventhfloor corridor He skidded to a halt beside the tapestry of dancing trolls closed his eyes and began to walk I need a place to hide my book I need a place to hide my book I need a place to hide my book CHAPTER TWENTYFOUR 526 Three times he walked up and do wn in front of the stretch of blank wall When he opened his eyes there it was at last the door to the Room of Requirement Harry wrenched it open flung himself inside and slammed it shut He gasped Despite his haste his panic his fear of what awaited him back in the bathroom he coul d not help but be overawed by what he was looking at He was st anding in a room the size of a large cathedral whose high windows were sending shafts of light down upon what looked like a city with towering walls built of what Harry knew must be objects hidden by generations of Hogwarts inhabitants There were alle yways and roads bordered by teetering piles of broken and da maged furniture stowed away perhaps to hide the evidence of mi shandled magic or else hidden by castleproud houseelves Th ere were thousands and thousands of books no doubt banned or gr affitied or stolen There were winged catapults and Fanged Frisbees some still with enough life in them to hover halfheartedly over the mountains of other forbidden items there were chipped bottles of congealed potions hats jewels cloaks there were what looked like dragon eggshells corked bottles whose contents still shimmered evi lly several rusting swords and a heavy bloodstained axe Harry hurried forward into one of the many alleyways between all this hidden treasure He turned right past an enormous stuffed troll ran on a short way took a left at the broken Vanishing Cabinet in which Montague had got lost the previous year finally pausing beside a large cupboard that se emed to have had acid thrown at its blistered surface He opened one of the cupboards creaking doors It had already been used as a hiding place for something in a cage that had long since died its skeleton had five legs He stuffed SECTUMSEMPRA 527 the HalfBlood Princes book be hind the cage and slammed the door He paused for a moment his heart thumping horribly gazing around at all the clutter Would he be able to find this spot again amidst all this junk Seizing the chipped bust of an ugly old warlock from on top of a nearby crate he stood it on top of the cupboard where the book was now hidden perched a dusty old wig and a tarnished tiara on the statues head to make it more distinctive then sprinted back through the alleyways of hidden junk as fast as he could go back to th e door back out onto the corridor where he slammed the door behind him and it turned at once back into stone Harry ran flatout toward the bathroom on the floor below cramming Rons copy of Advanced PotionMaking into his bag as he did so A minute later he was back in front of Snape who held out his hand wordlessly for Harrys schoolbag Harry handed it over panting a searing pain in his chest and waited One by one Snape extracted Harrys books and examined them Finally the only book left was the Potions book which he looked at very carefully before speaking This is your copy of Advanced PotionMaking is it Potter Yes said Harry still breathing hard Youre quite sure of that are you Potter Yes said Harry with a touch more defiance This is the copy of Advanced PotionMaking that you purchased from Flourish and Blotts Yes said Harry firmly Then why asked Snape does it have the name Roonil Wazlib written inside the front cover Harrys heart missed a beat T hats my nickname he said CHAPTER TWENTYFOUR 528 Your nickname repeated Snape Yeah thats what my fr iends call me said Harry I understand what a nickname is said Snape The cold black eyes were boring once more into Harrys he tried not to look into them Close your mind Close your mind But he had never learned how to do it properly Do you know what I think Potter said Snape very quietly I think that you are a liar and a cheat and that you deserve detention with me every Saturday until the end of term What do you think Potter I I dont agree sir said Ha rry still refusing to look into Snapes eyes Well we shall see how you feel after your detentions said Snape Ten oclock Saturday morning Potter My office But sir said Harry lookin g up desperately Quidditch the last match of the Ten oclock whispered Snape with a smile that showed his yellow teeth Poor Gryffindor fourth place this year I fear And he left the bathroom with out another word leaving Harry to stare into the cracked mirror feeling sicker he was sure than Ron had ever felt in his life I wont say I told you so said Hermione an hour later in the common room Leave it Hermione said Ron angrily Harry had never made it to dinner he had no appetite at all He had just finished telling Ron Hermione and Ginny what had happened not that there seemed to have been much need The news had traveled very fast Apparently Moaning Myrtle had taken it SECTUMSEMPRA 529 upon herself to pop up in every bathroom in the castle to tell the story Malfoy had already been vi sited in the hospital wing by Pansy Parkinson who had lost no time in vilifying Harry far and wide and Snape had told the staff precisely what had happened Harry had already been called out of the common room to endure fifteen highly unpleasant minute s in the company of Professor McGonagall who had told him he was lucky not to have been expelled and that she supported wh oleheartedly Snapes punishment of detention every Saturday until the end of term I told you there was something wrong with that Prince person Hermione said evidently unable to stop herself And I was right wasnt I No I dont think you were said Harry stubbornly He was having a bad enough ti me without Hermione lecturing him the looks on the Gryffindor teams faces when he had told them he would not be able to pl ay on Saturday had been the worst punishment of all He could feel Ginnys eyes on him now but did not meet them he di d not want to see disappointment or anger there He had just told her that she would be playin g Seeker on Saturday and that Dean would be rejo ining the team as Chaser in her place Perhaps if they won Gi nny and Dean would make up during the postmatch euphoria The thought went through Harry like an ic y knife Harry said Hermione how can you still stick up for that book when that spell Will you stop harping on ab out the book snapped Harry The Prince only copied it out Its not like he was advising anyone to use it For all we know he was making a note of something that had been used against him CHAPTER TWENTYFOUR 530 I dont believe this said He rmione Youre actually defending Im not defending what I did said Harry quickly I wish I hadnt done it and not just beca use Ive got about a dozen detentions You know I wouldntve used a spell like that not even on Malfoy but you cant blame the Prin ce he hadnt written try this out its really good he was ju st making notes for himself wasnt he not for anyone else Are you telling me said Hermione that youre going to go back And get the book Yeah I am said Harry forcefully Listen without the Prince Id never have won the Felix Felicis Id never have known how to save Ron from poisoning Id never have got a reputation for Potions brilliance you dont deserve said Hermione nastily Give it a rest Hermione said Ginny and Harry was so amazed so grateful he looked up By the sound of it Malfoy was trying to use an Unforgivable Cu rse you should be glad Harry had something good up his sleeve Well of course Im glad Harry wasnt cursed said Hermione clearly stung But yo u cant call that Sect umsempra spell good Ginny look where its landed him And Id have thought seeing what this has done to your chances in the match Oh dont start acting as thou gh you understand Quidditch snapped Ginny youll on ly embarrass yourself Harry and Ron stared Hermione and Ginny who had always got on together very well were no w sitting with their arms folded glaring in opposite directions Ro n looked nervously at Harry then snatched up a book at random an d hid behind it Harry however SECTUMSEMPRA 531 little though he knew he deserved it felt unbeliev ably cheerful all of a sudden even though none of th em spoke again for the rest of the evening His lightheartedness was short lived There were Slytherin taunts to be endured next day not to mention much anger from fellow Gryffindors who were most unhappy that their Captain had got himself banned from the final match of the season By Saturday morning whatever he might ha ve told Hermione Harry would have gladly exchanged all the Felix Felicis in the world to be walking down to the Quidditch pitch with Ron Ginny and the others It was almost unbearable to turn away from the mass of students streaming out into the sunshine all of them wearing rosettes and hats and brandishing banners and scarves to descend the stone steps into the dungeons and walk until the distant sounds of the crowd were quite obliterated knowin g that he would not be able to hear a word of commenta ry or a cheer or groan Ah Potter said Snape when Harry had knocked on his door and entered the unpleasantly famili ar office that Snape despite teaching floors above now had not vacated it was as dimly lit as ever and the same slimy dead objects were suspended in colored potions all around the walls Om inously there were many cobwebbed boxes piled on a table wh ere Harry was clearly supposed to sit they had an aura of tediou s hard and pointless work about them Mr Filch has been looking for someone to clear out these old files said Snape softly They ar e the records of other Hogwarts wrongdoers and thei r punishments Where the ink has grown faint or the cards have suffered damage from mice we would like you to copy out the crimes and punishments afresh and making CHAPTER TWENTYFOUR 532 sure that they are in alphabetical order replace them in the boxes You will not use magic Right Professor said Harry wi th as much contempt as he could put into the la st three syllables I thought you could start said Snape a malicious smile on his lips with boxes one thousand an d twelve to one thousand and fiftysix You will find some famili ar names in there which should add interest to the task Here you see He pulled out a card from one of the topmost boxes with a flourish and read James Potter and Sirius Black Apprehended using an illegal hex upon Bertram Aubrey Aubreys head twice normal size Double detention Snape sneered It must be such a comfort to think that though they are gone a record of thei r great achievements remains Harry felt the familiar boiling se nsation in the pit of his stomach Biting his tongue to prevent himself retaliating he sat down in front of the boxes and pulled one toward him It was as Harry had anticipated useless boring work punctuated as Snape had clearly planne d with the regular jolt in the s t o m a c h t h a t m e a n t h e h a d j u s t r e a d h i s f a t h e r o r S i r i u s s n a m e s usually coupled together in various petty misdeeds occasionally accompanied by those of Remus Lu pin and Peter Pettigrew And while he copied out all their vari ous offenses and punishments he wondered what was going on outs ide where the match would have just started Ginny play ing Seeker agai nst Cho Harry glanced again and again at the large clock ticking on the wall It seemed to be moving half as fast as a regular clock perhaps Snape had bewitched it to go extr a slowly He could not have been here for only half an hour an hour an hour and a half SECTUMSEMPRA 533 Harrys stomach started rumbling when the clock showed half past twelve Snape who had not spoken at all since setting Harry his task finally looked up at ten past one I think that will do he said coldly Mark the place you have reached You will continue at ten oclock next Saturday Yes sir Harry stuffed a bent card into the box at random and hurried out of the door before Snape coul d change his mind racing back up the stone steps straining his ears to hear a sound from the pitch but all was quiet It was over then He hesitated outside the crowde d Great Hall then ran up the marble staircase whether Gryffi ndor had won or lost the team usually celebrated or commiser ated in their own common room Quid agis he said tentatively to the Fat Lady wondering what he would find inside Her expression was unreadable as she replied Youll see And she swung forward A roar of celebration erupted from the hole behind her Harry gaped as people began to scream at the sight of him several hands pulled him into the room We won yelled Ron bounding into sight and brandishing the silver Cup at Harry We won Four hundred and fifty to a hundred and forty We won Harry looked around there was Ginny running toward him she had a hard blazing look in her fa ce as she threw her arms around him And without thinking withou t planning it without worrying about the fact that fifty people were watching Ha rry kissed her After several long moments or it might have been half an hour or possibly several sunlit days they broke apart The CHAPTER TWENTYFOUR 534 room had gone very quiet Then several people wolfwhistled and there was an outbreak of nervous giggling Harry looked over the top of Ginnys head to see Dean Thomas holding a shattered glass in his hand and Romilda Vane lo oking as though she might throw something Hermione was beaming but Harrys eyes sought Ron At last he found him still clutching the Cup and wearing an expression appropriate to having b een clubbed over the head For a fraction of a second they looked at each other then Ron gave a tiny jerk of the head that Harry understood to mean Well if you must The creature in his chest roaring in triumph he grinned down at Ginny and gestured wordlessly out of the portrait hole A long walk in the grounds seemed indica ted during which if they had time they might discuss the match T W E N T Y F I V E 535 THE SEER OVERHEARD he fact that Harry Potter was going out with Ginny Weasley seemed to interest a great number of people most of them girls yet Harry found himself newly and happily impervious to gossip over the next few weeks After all it made a very nice change to be talked about becaus e of something that was making him happier than he could rememb er being for a very long time rather than because he had been in volved in horrific scenes of Dark Magic Youd think people had better things to gossip about said Ginny as she sat on the common room floor leaning against Harrys legs and reading the Daily Prophet Three dementor attacks in a week and all Romilda Va ne does is ask me if its true youve got a hippogriff tattooed across your chest Ron and Hermione both roared with laughter Harry ignored them T CHAPTER TWENTYFIVE 536 What did you tell her I told her its a Hungarian Ho rntail said Ginny turning a page of the newspaper id ly Much more macho Thanks said Harry grinning And what did you tell her Rons got A Pygmy Puff but I didnt say where Ron scowled as Hermione rolled around laughing Watch it he said pointing warningly at Harry and Ginny Just because Ive given my permission doesnt mean I cant withdraw it Your permission scoffed Ginny Since when did you give me permission to do anything Anyway you said yourself youd rather it was Harry than Michael or Dean Yeah I would said Ron grudging ly And just as long as you dont start snogging each other in public You filthy hypocrite What ab out you and Lavender thrashing around like a pair of eels all over the place demanded Ginny But Rons tolerance was not to be t e s t e d m u c h a s t h e y m o v e d into June for Harry and Ginnys time together was becoming increasingly restricted Ginnys O WLs were approaching and she was therefore forced to study for ho urs into the night On one such evening when Ginny had retired to the library and Harry was sitting beside the window in the common room supposedly finishing his Herbology homework but in reality reliving a particularly happy hour he had spent down by the lake with Ginny at lunchtime Hermione dropped into the seat between him and Ron with an unpleasantly purpos eful look on her face I want to talk to you Harry What about said Harry suspicio usly Only the previous day THE SEER OVERHEARD 537 Hermione had told him off for distracting Ginny when she ought to be working hard for her examinations The socalled HalfBlood Prince Oh not again he groaned Will you please drop it He had not dared to return to the Room of Requirement to retrieve his book and his performance in Potions was suffering accordingly though Slughorn who a pproved of Ginny had jocularly attributed this to Harry being lo vesick But Harry was sure that Snape had not yet given up hope of laying hands on the Princes book and was determined to leave it where it was while Snape remained on the lookout Im not dropping it said Herm ione firmly until youve heard me out Now Ive been trying to find out a bit about who might make a hobby of invent ing Dark spells He didnt make a hobby of it He he who says its a he Weve been through this said Harry crossly Prince Hermione Prince Right said Hermione red patches blazing in her cheeks as she pulled a very old piece of newsprint out of her pocket and slammed it down on the table in front of Harry Look at that Look at the picture Harry picked up the crumbling piece of paper and stared at the moving photograph yellowed with ag e Ron leaned over for a look too The picture showed a skinny gi rl of around fifteen She was not pretty she looked simultaneously cross and sullen with heavy brows and a long pallid face Underneath the photograph was the caption Eileen Prince Captain of the Hogwarts Gobstones Team CHAPTER TWENTYFIVE 538 So said Harry scanning the sh ort news item to which the picture belonged it was a rather dull story about interschool competitions Her name was Eileen Prince Prince Harry They looked at each other an d Harry realized what Hermione was trying to say He burst out laughing No way What You think she was the HalfBlood Oh come on Well why not Harry there aren t any real princes in the Wizarding world Its either a nickname a madeup title somebodys given themselves or it could be th eir actual name couldnt it No listen If say her father was a wizard whose surname was Prince and her mother was a Muggle th en that would make her a halfblood Prince Yeah very ingenious Hermione But it would Maybe she was pr oud of being ha lf a Prince Listen Hermione I can tell its not a girl I can just tell The truth is that you dont think a girl would have been clever enough said Hermione angrily How can I have hung round wi th you for five years and not think girls are clever said Harry stung by this Its the way he writes I just know the Prince was a bloke I can tell This girl hasnt got anything to do with it Wh ere did you get this anyway The library said Hermione pred ictably Theres a whole collection of old Prophets up there Well Im going to find out more about Eileen Prin ce if I can Enjoy yourself sa id Harry irritably I will said Hermione And the first place Ill look she shot THE SEER OVERHEARD 539 at him as she reached the portrait hole is records of old Potions awards Harry scowled after her for a mo ment then continued his contemplation of th e darkening sky Shes just never got over you outperforming her in Potions said Ron returning to his copy of A Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi You dont think Im mad want ing that book back do you Course not said Ron robustly He was a genius the Prince Anyway without his bezoar tip He drew his finger significantly across his own throat I wo u l d n t b e h e r e t o d i s c u s s i t would I I mean Im not saying th at spell you used on Malfoy was great Nor am I said Harry quickly But he healed all right didnt he Back on his feet in no time Yeah said Harry this was pe rfectly true although his conscience squirmed slight ly all the same Tha nks to Snape You still got detention with Snape this Saturday Ron continued Yeah and the Saturday after that and the Saturday after that sighed Harry And hes hinting no w that if I dont get all the boxes done by the end of term well carry on next year He was finding these detentions particularly irksome because they cut into the already limited time he could have been spending with Ginny Indeed he had frequently wondered lately whether Snape did not know this for he was keeping Harry later and later every time while making pointed asides about Harry having to miss the good weather and the vari ed opportunities it offered Harry was shaken from these bitter reflections by the appearance CHAPTER TWENTYFIVE 540 at his side of Jimm y Peakes who was holding out a scroll of parchment Thanks Jimmy Hey its from Dumbledore said Harry excitedly unrolling the parchmen t and scanning it He wants me to go to his office as quick as I can They stared at each other Blimey whispered Ron You dont reckon he hasnt found Better go and see hadnt I sa id Harry jumping to his feet He hurried out of the common room an d along the seventh floor as fast as he could passi ng nobody but Peeves who swooped past in the opposite direction th rowing bits of ch alk at Harry in a routine sort of way and cackling loudly as he dodged Harrys defensive jinx Once Peeves had vani shed there was silence in the corridors with only fifteen minute s left until curfew most people had already returned to their common rooms And then Harry heard a scream an d a crash He stopped in his tracks listening How dare you aaaaargh The noise was coming from a corridor nearby Harry sprinted toward it his wand at the ready hurtled around another corner and saw Professor Trelawney sprawled upon the floor her head covered in one of her many shawls several sherry bottles lying beside her one broken Professor Harry hurried forward and helped Professor Trelawney to her feet Some of her glittering bead s had become entangled with her glasses She hiccuped loudly patted her hair and pulled herself up on Harrys helping arm THE SEER OVERHEARD 541 What happened Professor You may well ask she said shrilly I was strolling along brooding upon certain dark portents I happen to have glimpsed But Harry was not paying much at tention He had just noticed where they were standing There on the right was the tapestry of dancing trolls and on the left that smoothly impenetrable stretch of stone wall th at concealed Professor were you trying to get into the Room of Requirement omens I have been vouchsafed what She looked suddenly shifty The Room of Requirement repeated Harry Were you trying to get in there I well I didnt know students knew about Not all of them do said Harry But what happened You screamed It sounded as though you were hurt I well said Professor Trelawney drawing her shawls around her defensively and staring down at him with her vastly magnified eyes I wished to ah deposi t certain um personal items in the room And she muttere d something about nasty accusations Right said Harry glancing dow n at the sherry bottles But you couldnt get in and hide them He found this very odd the room had opened for him after all when he had wanted to hide the HalfBlood Pr inces book Oh I got in all right said Pr ofessor Trelawney glaring at the wall But there was some body already in there Somebody in Who dema nded Harry Who was in there CHAPTER TWENTYFIVE 542 I have no idea said Professor Trelawney looking slightly taken aback at the urgency in Harrys voic e I walked into the room and I heard a voice which has never ha ppened before in all my years of hiding of using th e room I mean A voice Saying what I dont know that it was sa ying anything said Professor Trelawney It was whooping Whooping Gleefully she said nodding Harry stared at her Was it male or female I would hazard a guess at male said Professor Trelawney And it sounded happy Very happy said Profes sor Trelawney sniffily As though it was celebrating Most definitely And then And then I called out Whos there You couldnt have found out who it was without asking Harry asked her slightly frustrated The Inner Eye said Professor Tr elawney with dignity straightening her shawls and many strands of glittering beads was fixed upon matters well outside the mundane realms of whooping voices Right said Harry hastily he had heard ab out Professor Trelawneys Inner Eye all too oft en before And did the voice say who was there No it did not she said Everything went pitchblack and the next thing I knew I was being hurl ed headfirst out of the room THE SEER OVERHEARD 543 A n d y o u d i d n t s e e t h a t c o m i n g s a i d H a r r y u n a b l e t o h e l p himself No I did not as I say it wa s pitch She stopped and glared at him suspiciously I think youd better tell Profe ssor Dumbledore said Harry He ought to know Malfoys celebrating I mean that someone threw you out of the room To his surprise Professor Trelawney drew herself up at this suggestion looking haughty The headmaster has intimated that he would prefer fewer visits from me she said coldly I am not one to press my company upon those who do not value it If Dumbledore chooses to ignore the warnings the cards show Her bony hand closed suddenly around Harrys wrist Again and again no matter how I lay them out And she pulled a card dramatically from underneath her shawls the lightningstruck to wer she whispered Calamity Disaster Coming nearer all the time Right said Harry again Well I still think you should tell Dumbledore about this voice and everything going dark and being thrown out of the room You think so Professor Trelawney seemed to consider the matter for a moment but Harry coul d tell that she liked the idea of retelling her little adventure Im going to see him right now said Harry Ive got a meeting with him We coul d go together Oh well in that case said Professor Trelawney with a smile She bent down scooped up her sherry bottles and dumped them unceremoniously in a large blueandwhite vase standing in a nearby niche CHAPTER TWENTYFIVE 544 I miss having you in my classe s Harry she said soulfully as they set off together You were never much of a Seer but you were a wonderful Object Harry did not reply he had loathe d being the Object of Professor Trelawneys continua l predictions of doom I am afraid she went on t hat the nag Im sorry the centaur knows nothing of cartoman cy I asked him one Seer to another had he not too sensed the distant vibrations of coming catastrophe But he seemed to find me almost comical Yes comical Her voice rose rather hysterical ly and Harry caught a powerful whiff of sherry even though the bottles had been left behind Perhaps the horse has heard people say that I have not inherited my greatgreatgrandm others gift Those rumors have been bandied about by the jealous for year s You know what I say to such people Harry Would Dumbledore ha ve let me teach at this great school put so much trust in me all these years had I not proved myself to him Harry mumbled something indistinct I well remember my first in terview with Dumbledore went on Professor Trelawney in throaty tones He was deeply impressed of course deeply impresse d I was staying at the Hogs Head which I do not advise incid entally bedbugs dear boy but funds were low Dumbledore di d me the courtesy of calling upon me in my room He questio ned me I must confess that at first I thought he seemed ill disposed toward Divination and I remember I was starting to feel a little odd I had not eaten much that day but then And now Harry was paying attentio n properly for the first time THE SEER OVERHEARD 545 for he knew what had happened then Professor Trelawney had made the prophecy that had altered the course of his whole life the prophecy about him and Voldemort but then we were rudely interrupted by Severus Snape What Yes there was a commotion outs ide the door and it flew open and there was that rather uncout h barman standing with Snape who was waffling about having come the wrong way up the stairs although Im afraid that I myself rather thought he had been apprehended eavesdropping on my interview with Dumbledore you see he himself was seeking a job at the time and no doubt hoped to pick up tips Well after that you know Dumbledore seemed much more disposed to give me a job and I could not help thinking Harry that it was because he appreciated the stark contrast between my own unassuming manners and quiet talent compared to the pushing thrusting young man who was prepared to listen at keyholes Harry dear She looked back over her shoulder having only just realized that Harry was no longer with her he had stopped walking and they were now ten feet from each other Harry she repeat ed uncertainly Perhaps his face was white to ma ke her look so concerned and frightened Harry was standing st ockstill as waves of shock crashed over him wave after wave obliterating everything except the information that had been ke pt from him for so long It was Snape who had overheard the prophecy It was Snape who had carried the news of the prop hecy to Voldemort Snape and Peter Pettigrew together had sent Voldemort hunting after Lily and James and their son CHAPTER TWENTYFIVE 546 Nothing else mattered to Harry just now Harry said Professor Trelaw ney again Harry I thought we were going to see the headmaster together You stay here said Harry through numb lips But dear I was going to tell him how I was assaulted in the Room of You stay here Harr y repeated angrily She looked alarmed as he ran past her around the corner into Dumbledores corridor where the lone gargoyle stood sentry Harry shouted the password at the gargoyle and ran up the moving spiral staircase three steps at a time He did not knock upon Dumbledores door he hammered an d the calm voice answered Enter after Harry had already flung himself into the room Fawkes the phoenix looked around his bright black eyes gleaming with reflected gold from th e sunset beyond the windows Dumbledore was standing at th e window looking out at the grounds a long black traveling cloak in his arms Well Harry I promised that you could come with me For a moment or two Harry di d not understand the conversation with Trelawney had driven eve rything else out of his head and his brain seemed to be moving very slowly Come with you Only if you wish it of course If I And then Harry remember ed why he had been eager to come to Dumbledores office in the first pl ace Youve found one Youve found a Horcrux I believe so THE SEER OVERHEARD 547 Rage and resentment fought shock and excitement For several moments Harry could not speak It is natural to be afraid said Dumbledore Im not scared said Harry at once and it was perfectly true fear was one emotion he was not feel ing at all Which Horcrux is it Where is it I am not sure which it is though I think we can rule out the snake but I believe it to be hi dden in a cave on the coast many miles from here a cave I have been trying to locate for a very long time the cave in which Tom Riddl e once terrorized two children from his orphanage on their annual trip you remember Yes said Harry How is it protected I do not know I have suspicions that may be entirely wrong Dumbledore hesitated then said H arry I promised you that you could come with me and I stand by that promise but it would be very wrong of me not to warn you that this will be exceedingly dangerous Im coming said Harry almo st before Dumbledore had finished speaking Boiling with anger at Snape his desire to do something desperate and risky had incr eased tenfold in the last few minutes This seemed to show on Harrys face for Dumbledore moved away from the window and looked more closely at Harry a slight crease between his silver eyebrows What has happened to you Nothing lied Harry promptly What has upset you Im not upset Harry you were never a good Occlumens CHAPTER TWENTYFIVE 548 The word was the spark th at ignited Harrys fury Snape he said very loudly and Fawkes gave a soft squawk behind them Snapes whats happ ened He told Voldemort about the prophecy it was him he listened outsid e the door Trelawney told me Dumbledores expression did no t change but Ha rry thought his face whitened under the bloody tinge cast by the setting sun For a long moment Dumbledore said no thing When did you find out about this he asked at last Just now said Harry who was refraining from yelling with enormous difficulty And then su ddenly he coul d not stop himself AND YOU LET HIM TEACH HERE AND HE TOLD VOLDEMORT TO GO AFTER MY MUM AND DAD Breathing hard as though he was fighting Harry turned away from Dumbledore who still had not moved a muscle and paced up and down the study rubbing his knuckles in his hand and exercising every last bit of restraint to prevent himself knocking things over He wanted to rage and st orm at Dumbledore but he also wanted to go with him to try an d destroy the Horcrux he wanted to tell him that he was a foolish ol d man for trusting Snape but he was terrified that Dumbledore would not take him along unless he mastered his anger Harry said Dumbledore quietly Please listen to me It was as difficult to stop his relentless pacing as to refrain from shouting Harry paused biting his lip and looked into Dumbledores lined face Professor Snape made a terrible Dont tell me it was a mistake sir he was listen ing at the door Please let me finish Dumb ledore waited until Harry had THE SEER OVERHEARD 549 nodded curtly then went on Professor Snape made a terrible mistake He was still in Lord Voldemor ts employ on the night he heard the first half of Professor Trelawney s prophecy Naturally he hastened to tell his master what he had heard for it concerned his master most deeply But he did no t know he had no possible way of knowing which boy Voldemort would hunt from then onward or that the parents he would destroy in his murderous quest were people that Professor Snape knew that they we re your mother and father Harry let out a yell of mirthless laughter He hated my dad like he hate d Sirius Havent you noticed Professor how the people Snape hates tend to end up dead You have no idea of the remo rse Professor Snape felt when he realized how Lord Voldemort had interpreted the prophecy Harry I believe it to be the greatest regret of his life and th e reason that he returned But hes a very good Occlumens isnt he sir said Harry whose voice was shaking with the effort of keeping it steady And isnt Voldemort convinced that Snapes on his side even now Professor how can you be sure Snapes on our side Dumbledore did not speak for a moment he looked as though he was trying to make up his mi nd about something At last he said I am sure I trust Severus Snape completely Harry breathed deeply for a few moments in an effort to steady himself It did not work Well I dont he said as loudly as before Hes up to something with Draco Malfoy right now right under your nose and you still We have discussed this Harry said Dumbledore and now he sounded stern again I ha ve told you my views CHAPTER TWENTYFIVE 550 Youre leaving the school tonight and Ill bet you havent even considered that Snape and Ma lfoy might decide to To what asked Dumbledore his eyebrows raised What is it that you suspect them of doing precisely I theyre up to something said Harry and his hands curled into fists as he said it Professor Trelawney was just in the Room of Requirement trying to hide her sherry bottles and she heard Malfoy whooping celebrating Hes trying to mend something dangerous in there and if you ask me hes fixed it at last and youre about to just walk out of school without Enough said Dumbledore He said it quite calmly and yet Harry fell silent at once he knew that he had finally crossed some invisible line Do you think that I have once left the school unprotected during my absences this year I have not Tonight when I leave there will again be additional protection in place Please do not suggest that I do not take the safety of my students seriously Harry I didnt mumbled Harry a little abashed but Dumbledore cut across him I do not wish to discuss the matter any further Harry bit back his retort scared th at he had gone too far that he had ruined his chance of acco mpanying Dumbledore but Dumbledore went on Do you wish to come with me tonight Yes said Harry at once Very well then Listen Dumb ledore drew himself up to his full height I take you with me on one condition that you obey any command I might gi ve you at once and without question Of course Be sure to understand me Harry I mean that you must follow THE SEER OVERHEARD 551 even such orders as run hide or go back Do I have your word I yes of course If I tell you to hide you will do so Yes If I tell you to flee you will obey Yes If I tell you to leave me and save yourself you will do as I tell you I Harry They looked at each other for a moment Yes sir Very good Then I wish you to go and fetch your Invisibility Cloak and meet me in the entrance hall in five minutes time Dumbledore turned back to look out of the fiery window the sun was now a ruby red glare along the horizon Harry walked quickly from the office and down th e spiral staircase His mind was oddly clear all of a sudden He knew what to do Ron and Hermione were sitting together in the common room when he came back What does he want Hermione said at once Harry are you okay she added anxiously Im fine said Harry shortly ra cing past them He dashed up the stairs and into his dormitory where he flung open his trunk and pulled out the Marauders Map and a pair of balledup socks Then he sped back down the stairs and into the common room skidding to a halt where Ron and Hermione sat looking stunned Ive got to be quick Harry panted Dumbledore thinks Im getting my Invisibility Cloak Listen CHAPTER TWENTYFIVE 552 Quickly he told them where he was going and why He did not pause either for Hermiones gasps of horror or for Rons hasty questions they could work out the fi ner details for th emselves later so you see what this means Harry finished at a gallop Dumbledore wont be here tonight so Malfoys going to have another clear shot at wh atever hes up to No listen to me he hissed angrily as both Ron and Hermione showed every sign of interrupting I know it was Malfoy celebrating in the Room of Requirement Here He shoved the Ma rauders Map into Hermiones hands Youve got to watch him an d youve got to watch Snape too Use anyone else who you can rustle up from the DA Hermione those contact Galleons will still work right Dumbledore says hes put extra protection in the school but if Snapes involved hell know what Dumbledores protection is and how to avoid it but he wont be expecting you lot to be on the watch will he Harry began He rmione her eyes huge with fear I havent got time to argue said Harry cu rtly Take this as well He thrust the socks into Rons hands Thanks said Ron Er why do I need socks You need whats wrapped in them its the Felix Felicis Share it between yourselves and Ginny too Say goodbye to her for me Id better go Dumbledores waiting No said Hermione as Ron unwrapped the tiny little bottle of golden potion looking awestruck We dont want it you take it who knows what youre going to be facing Ill be fine Ill be with Dumb ledore said Harry I want to know you lot are okay Dont look like that Hermione Ill see you later THE SEER OVERHEARD 553 And he was off hurrying back th rough the portrait hole and toward the entrance hall Dumbledore was waiting beside the oaken front doors He turned as Harry came skidding out onto the topmost stone step panting hard a searing stitch in his side I would like you to wear your cloak please said Dumbledore and he waited until Harry had thro wn it on before saying Very good Shall we go Dumbledore set off at once down the stone steps his own traveling cloak barely stirring in th e still summer air Harry hurried alongside him under the Invisibility Cloak still panting and sweating rather a lot But what will people think when they see you leaving Professor Harry asked his mind on Malfoy and Snape That I am off into Hogsmeade for a drink said Dumbledore lightly I sometimes offer Rosmer ta my custom or else visit the Hogs Head or I appear to It is as good a way as any of disguising ones true destination They made their way down the dr ive in the gathering twilight The air was full of the smells of warm grass lake water and wood smoke from Hagrids cabin It was difficult to believe that they were heading for anything dangerous or frightening Professor said Harry quietly as the gates at the bottom of the drive came into view will we be Apparating Yes said Dumbledore You can Apparate now I believe Yes said Harry but I havent got a license He felt it best to be honest wh at if he spoiled everything by turning up a hundred miles from where he was supposed to go No matter said Dumbledore I can assist you again CHAPTER TWENTYFIVE 554 They turned out of the gates into the twilit deserted lane to Hogsmeade Darkness descended fast as they walked and by the time they reached the High Street night was falling in earnest Lights twinkled from windows ov er shops and as they neared the Three Broomsticks they heard raucous shouting and stay out shouted Madam Rosmerta forcibly ejecting a grubbylooking wizard O h hello Albus Yo ure out late Good evening Rosmerta good evening forgive me Im off to the Hogs Head No offense but I feel like a quieter atmosphere tonight A minute later they turned the co rner into the side street where the Hogs Heads sign creaked a li ttle though there was no breeze In contrast to the Three Broomstic ks the pub appeared to be completely empty It will not be necessary for us to enter muttered Dumbledore glancing around As long as nobody sees us go now place your hand upon my arm Harry There is no need to grip too hard I am merely guiding you On the count of three One two three Harry turned At once there was th at horrible sensation that he was being squeezed through a thick rubber tube he could not draw breath every part of him was be ing compressed almost past endurance and then just when he thought he must suffocate the invisible bands seemed to burst open and he was stan ding in cool darkness breathing in lungfuls of fresh salty air T W E N T Y S I X 555 THE CAVE arry could smell salt and hear rushing waves a light chilly breeze ruffled his hair as he looked out at moonlit sea and starstrewn sky He wa s standing upon a high outcrop of dark rock water foaming and ch urning below him He glanced over his shoulder A towering cli ff stood behind them a sheer drop black and faceless A few large ch unks of rock such as the one upon which Harry and Dumbledore were standing looked as though they had broken away from the cliff face at some point in the past It was a bleak harsh view the sea and the rock unrelieved by any tree or swee p of grass or sand What do you think asked Dumbledore He might have been asking Harrys opinion on whether it was a good si te for a picnic They brought the kids from th e orphanage here asked Harry who could not imagine a less cozy spot for a day trip Not here precisely said Dumb ledore There is a village of sorts about halfway along the cliffs behind us I believe the orphans H CHAPTER TWENTYSIX 556 were taken there for a little sea ai r and a view of the waves No I think it was only ever Tom Riddle and his youthful victims who visited this spot No Muggle could reach this rock unless they were uncommonly good mountaineers an d boats cannot approach the cliffs the waters around them ar e too dangerous I imagine that Riddle climbed down magic would ha ve served better than ropes And he brought two small childr en with him probably for the pleasure of terrorizing them I t hink the journey alone would have done it dont you Harry looked up at the cliff again and felt goose bumps But his final destination and ou rs lies a little farther on Come Dumbledore beckoned Harry to the very edge of the rock where a series of jagged niches made f ootholds leading down to boulders that lay halfsubmerged in water an d closer to the cliff It was a treacherous descent and Dumbledore hampered slightly by his withered hand moved slowly The lower rocks were slippery with seawater Harry could feel flecks of cold salt spray hitting his face Lumos said Dumbledore as he re ached the boulder closest to the cliff face A thousand flecks of golden light sparkled upon the dark surface of the water a few fe et below where he crouched the black wall of rock beside him was illuminated too You see said Dumbledore quietly holding his wand a little higher Harry saw a fissure in the cliff into which dark water was swirling You will not object to getting a little wet No said Harry Then take off your In visibility Cloak ther e is no need for it now and let us ta ke the plunge THE CAVE 557 And with the sudden agility of a much younger man Dumbledore slid from the boulder landed in the sea and began to swim with a perfect breaststroke toward th e dark slit in the rock face his lit wand held in his teeth Harry pu lled off his cloak stuffed it into his pocket and followed The water was icy Harrys waterl ogged clothes billowed around him and weighed him down Taking deep breaths that filled his nostrils with the tang of salt and seaweed he struck out for the shimmering shrinking light now moving deeper into the cliff The fissure soon opened into a da rk tunnel that Harry could tell would be filled with water at high tide The slimy walls were barely three feet apart and glimmered like wet tar in the passing light of Dumbledores wand A little way in the passageway curved to the left and Harry saw that it extended far into th e cliff He continued to swim in Dumbledores wake th e tips of his benumbed fingers brushing the ro ugh wet rock Then he saw Dumbledore rising ou t of the water ahead his silver hair and dark robes gleaming When Harry reached the spot he found steps that led into a la rge cave He clambered up them water streaming from his soaking clothes and emerged shivering uncontrollably into the still and freezing air Dumbledore was standing in the middle of the cave his wand held high as he turned slowly on the spot examining the walls and ceiling Yes this is the plac e said Dumbledore How can you tell Ha rry spoke in a whisper It has known magic sa id Dumbledore simply Harry could not tell wh ether the shivers he was experiencing were due to his spinedeep coldness or to the same awareness of CHAPTER TWENTYSIX 558 enchantments He watc hed as Dumbledore co ntinued to revolve on the spot evidently concentratin g on things Harr y could not see This is merely the antechamber the entrance hall said Dumbledore after a moment or two We need to penetrate the inner place Now it is Lord Voldem orts obstacles that stand in our way rather than thos e nature made Dumbledore approached the wall of the cave and caressed it with his blackened fingertips murmuring words in a strange tongue that Harry did not unders tand Twice Dumbledore walked right around the cave touching as much of the rough rock as he could occasionally pausing running his fingers backward and forward over a particular spot unti l finally he stopped his hand pressed flat against the wall Here he said We go on thro ugh here The entrance is concealed Harry did not ask how Dumbledore knew He had never seen a wizard work things out like this simply by looking and touching but Harry had long since learned that bangs and smoke were more often the marks of ineptitude than expertise Dumbledore stepped back from th e cave wall and pointed his wand at the rock For a moment an arched outline appeared there blazing white as though there was a powerful light behind the crack Youve ddone it said Harry th rough chattering teeth but before the words had left his lips the outline had go ne leaving the rock as bare and solid as ev er Dumbledore looked around Harry Im so sorry I forgot he said he now pointed his wand at Harry and at once Harrys clothes were as warm and dry as if they had been hanging in front of a blazing fire THE CAVE 559 Thank you said Harry grat efully but Dumbledore had already turned his attention back to the solid cave wall He did not try any more magic but simply stood there staring at it intently as though something extremely interesting was written on it Harry stayed quite still he did not wa nt to break Dumbledores concentration Then after two solid minutes Dumbledore said quietly Oh surely not So crude What is it Professor I rather think said Dumbledor e putting his uninjured hand inside his robes and drawing out a short silver knife of the kind Harry used to chop potion ingredients that we are required to make payment to pass Payment said Harry Youve go t to give the door something Yes said Dumbledor e Blood if I am not much mistaken Blood I said it was crude said Du mbledore who sounded disdainful even disappointed as though Vo ldemort had fallen short of the standards Dumbledore expected The idea as I am sure you will have gathered is that your enemy must weaken him or herself to enter Once again Lord Voldemor t fails to grasp that there are much more terrible things than physical injury Yeah but still if you can avoid it said Harry who had experienced enough pain no t to be keen for more Sometimes however it is unavoidable said Dumbledore shaking back the sleeve of his robes and exposi ng the forearm of his injured hand Professor protested Harry hurrying forward as Dumbledore raised his knife Ill do it Im He did not know what he was going to say younger fitter CHAPTER TWENTYSIX 560 But Dumbledore merely smiled There was a flash of silver and a spurt of scarlet the rock face was peppered with dark glistening drops You are very kind Harry said Dumbledore now passing the tip of his wand over the deep cut he had made in his own arm so that it healed instantly just as Snape had healed Malfoys wounds But your blood is worth more than mine Ah that seems to have done the trick doesnt it The blazing silver outline of an arch had appeared in the wall once more and this time it did not fade away The bloodspattered r o c k w i t h i n i t s i m p l y v a n i s h e d leaving an opening into what seemed total darkness After me I think said Dumb ledore and he walked through the archway with Harry on his heels lighting his own wand hastily as he went An eerie sight met their eyes They were standing on the edge of a great black lake so vast that Harry could not make out the distant banks in a cavern so high that the ceiling too was out of sight A misty greenish light shone far aw ay in what looked like the middle of the lake it was reflected in the completely still water below The greenish glow and the light fr om the two wands were the only things that broke the otherwise velv ety blackness th ough their rays did not penetrate as fa r as Harry would have expected The darkness was somehow denser than normal darkness Let us walk said Dumbledore quietly Be very careful not to step into the water Stay close to me He set off around the edge of the lake and Harry followed close behind him Their footsteps made ec hoing slapping sounds on the narrow rim of rock that surrounded the water On and on they THE CAVE 561 walked but the view did not vary on one side of them the rough cavern wall on the other the bo undless expanse of smooth glassy blackness in the very middle of w hich was that mysterious greenish glow Harry found the pl ace and the silence oppressive unnerving Professor he said finally Do you think the Horcrux is here Oh yes said Dumbledore Yes Im sure it is The question is how do we get to it We couldnt we couldnt just try a Summoning Charm Harry said sure that it was a stup id suggestion But he was much keener than he was prepared to admit on getting out of this place as soon as possible Certainly we could said Du mbledore stopping so suddenly that Harry almo st walked into him W hy dont you do it Me Oh okay Harry had not expected this but cleared his throat and said loudly wand aloft Accio Horcrux With a noise like an explosion something very large and pale erupted out of the dark water some twenty feet away before Harry could see what it was it had vani shed again with a crashing splash that made great deep ripples on the mirrored surface Harry leapt backward in shock and hit the wall his heart was still thundering as he turned to Dumbledore What was that Something I think that is read y to respond should we attempt to seize the Horcrux Harry looked back at th e water The surface of the lake was once more shining black glass The ri pples had vanished unnaturally fast Harrys hear t however was still pounding Did you think that would happen sir CHAPTER TWENTYSIX 562 I thought something would happen if we made an obvious attempt to get our hands on the Ho rcrux That was a very good idea Harry much the simple st way of finding out what we are facing But we dont know what the th ing was said Harry looking at the sinisterly smooth water What the things are you mean said Dumbledore I doubt very much that there is only on e of them Shall we walk on Professor Yes Harry Do you think were going to ha ve to go into the lake Into it Only if we are very unfortunate You dont think the Horc rux is at the bottom Oh no I think the Horcrux is in the middle And Dumbledore pointed toward the misty green light in the center of the lake So were going to have to cr oss the lake to get to it Yes I think so Harry did not say anything His th oughts were all of water monsters of giant serpents of demo ns kelpies and sprites Aha said Dumbledore and he stopped again this time Harry really did walk into him for a mo ment he toppled on the edge of the dark water and Dumbledores uninjured hand closed tightly around his upper arm pulling hi m back So sorry Harry I should have given warning Stand back ag ainst the wall please I think I have found the place Harry had no idea what Dumbledore meant this patch of dark bank was exactly like every other bit as far as he could tell but Dumbledore seemed to have detect ed something special about it This time he was running his hand not over the rocky wall but THE CAVE 563 through the thin air as though expecting to find and grip something invisible Oho said Dumbledore happily seconds later His hand had closed in midair upon somethin g Harry could not see Dumbledore moved closer to the water Harry watched nervously as the tips of Dumbledores buckled shoe s found the utmost edge of the rock rim Keeping his hand clench ed in midair Dumbledore raised his wand with the other and tapp ed his fist with the point Immediately a thick coppery green chain appeared out of thin air extending from the depths of the water into Dumbledores clenched hand Dumbledore tapp ed the chain which began to slide through his fist like a snake coiling itself on the ground with a clinking sound that echoed nois ily off the rocky walls pulling something from the depths of the black water Harry gasped as the ghostly prow of a tiny boat broke the surface glowing as green as the chain and floated with barely a ripple toward the place on the bank where Harry an d Dumbledore stood How did you know that was th ere Harry asked in astonishment Magic always leaves traces sa id Dumbledore as the boat hit the bank with a gentle bump sometimes very distinctive traces I taught Tom Riddle I know his style Is is this boat safe Oh yes I think so Voldemort needed to create a means to cross the lake without attracting the wrath of those creatures he had placed within it in case he ever wanted to visit or remove his Horcrux So the things in the water wont do anything to us if we cross in Voldemorts boat CHAPTER TWENTYSIX 564 I think we must resign ourselves to the fact that they will at some point realize we are not Lord Voldemort Thus far however we have done well They have allowed us to raise the boat But why have they let us asked Harry who could not shake off the vision of tentacles rising out of the dark water the moment they were out of sight of the bank Voldemort would have been reasonably co nfident that none but a very great wizard would have b een able to find the boat said Dumbledore I think he would ha ve been prepared to risk what was to his mind the mo st unlikely possibility that somebody else would find it knowing that he ha d set other obstac les ahead that only he would be able to penetrate We shall see whether he is right Harry looked down into the boat It really was very small It doesnt look like it was built for two people Will it hold both of us Will we be too heavy together Dumbledore chuckled Voldemort will not have cared about the weight but about the amount of magical powe r that crossed his lake I rather think an enchantment will have been placed upon this boat so that only one wizard at a time will be able to sail in it But then I do not think you will count Harry You are underage and unqualified Voldemort would never have expected a sixteenyearold to reach this place I think it unlikely that your powers will register compared to mine These words did nothing to raise Harrys morale perhaps Dumbledore knew it for he added Voldemorts mistake Harry Voldemorts mistake Age is foolish and forgetful when it THE CAVE 565 underestimates youth Now yo u first this time and be careful not to touch the water Dumbledore stood aside and Harry climbed carefully into the boat Dumbledore stepped in too coiling the chain onto the floor They were crammed in together Harry could not comfortably sit but crouched his knees jutting over the edge of the boat which began to move at once There was no sound other than the silken rustle of the boats prow cleaving the water it moved without their help as though an invisible rope was pulling it onward toward the light in the center Soon they coul d no longer see the walls of the cavern they might have been at sea except that there were no waves Harry looked down and saw the refl ected gold of his wandlight sparkling and glittering on the blac k water as they passed The boat was carving deep ripples upon the glassy surface grooves in the dark mirror And then Harry saw it marble whit e floating inches below the surface Professor he said and his startl ed voice echoed loudly over the silent water Harry I think I saw a hand in the water a human hand Yes I am sure you did said Dumbledore calmly Harry stared down into the wate r looking for the vanished hand and a sick feelin g rose in his throat So that thing that jumped out of the water But Harry had his answer before Dumbledore could reply the wandlight had slid over a fresh pa tch of water and showed him this time a dead man lying faceup inch es beneath the surface his open CHAPTER TWENTYSIX 566 eyes misted as though with cobweb s his hair and his robes swirling around him like smoke There are bodies in here said Harry and his voice sounded much higher than usual an d most unlike his own Yes said Dumbledore placidly but we do not need to worry about them at the moment At the moment Harry repeated tearing his gaze from the water to look at Dumbledore Not while they are merely drif ting peacefully below us said Dumbledore There is nothing to be feared from a body Harry any more than there is anything to be feared from the darkness Lord Voldemort who of course se cretly fears both disagrees But once again he reveals his own lack of wisdom It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkne ss nothing more Harry said nothing he did not wa nt to argue but he found the idea that there were bodies floati ng around them and beneath them horrible and what was more he di d not believe that they were not dangerous But one of them jumped he sa id trying to make his voice as level and calm as Dumbledores When I tried to Summon the Horcrux a body leapt out of the lake Y e s s a i d D u m b l e d o r e I a m s u r e t h a t o n c e w e t a k e t h e Horcrux we shall find them less peaceable However like many creatures that dwell in cold an d darkness they fear light and warmth which we shall therefore call to our aid should the need arise Fire Harry Dumbledore added with a smile in response to Harrys bewildered expression Oh right said Harry quickly He turned his head to look at the greenish glow toward w hich the boat was still inexorably THE CAVE 567 sailing He could not pretend now that he was not scared The great black lake teeming with the dead It seemed hours and hours ago that he had met Professor Trelawney that he had given Ron and Hermione Felix Felicis He suddenly wished he had said a better goodbye to them and he hadnt seen Ginny at all Nearly there said Dumbledore cheerfully Sure enough the greenish light s eemed to be growing larger at last and within minutes the bo at had come to a halt bumping gently into something that Harry could not see at first but when he raised his illuminated wand he saw that they had reached a small island of smooth rock in the center of the lake Careful not to touch the wate r said Dumbledore again as Harry climbed out of the boat The island was no larger than Dumbledores office an expanse of flat dark stone on which stood nothing but the source of that greenish light which looked much brighter when viewed close to Harry squinted at it at first he thought it was a lamp of some kind but then he saw that the ligh t was coming from a stone basin rather like the Pensieve which was set on top of a pedestal Dumbledore approached the basin and Harry followed Side by side they looked down into it The basin was full of an emerald liquid emitting that ph osphorescent glow What is it aske d Harry quietly I am not sure said Dumbledor e Something more worrisome than blood and b odies however Dumbledore pushed back the sleeve of his robe over his blackened hand and stretched out the tips of his burned fingers toward the surface of the potion Sir no dont touch CHAPTER TWENTYSIX 568 I cannot touch said Dumbledore smiling faintly See I cannot approach any nearer than this You try Staring Harry put his hand into the basin and attempted to touch the potion He met an invisible barrier that prevented him coming within an inch of it No matter how hard he pushed his fingers encountered nothing but wh at seemed to be solid and inflexible air Out of the way please Harry said Dumbledore He raised his wand and made complicated move ments over the surface of the potion murmuring soundlessly Nothing happened except perhaps that the potion glowed a litt le brighter Harry remained silent while Dumbledore worked but af ter a while Dumbledore withdrew his wand and Harry felt it was safe to talk again You think the Horcrux is in there sir Oh yes Dumbledore peered mo re closely into the basin Harry saw his face reflected upside down in the smooth surface of the green potion But how to reac h it This potion cannot be penetrated by hand Vanished parted scooped up or siphoned away nor can it be Transfigured Charmed or otherwise made to change its nature Almost absentmindedly Dumbledore raised his wand again twirled it once in midair and then caught the crystal goblet that he had conjured out of nowhere I can only conclude that this potion is supposed to be drunk What said Harry No Yes I think so Only by drinki ng it can I empt y the basin and see what lies in its depths But what if what if it kills you Oh I doubt that it would work like that said Dumbledore THE CAVE 569 easily Lord Voldemort would not want to kill the person who reached this island Harry couldnt believe it Was th is more of Dumbledores insane determination to s ee good in everyone Sir said Harry trying to keep his voice reasonable sir this is Voldemort were Im sorry Harry I should have said he would not want to immediately kill the person who reache d this island Dumbledore corrected himself He would want to keep them alive long enough to find out how they managed to penetrate so far through his defenses and most importantly of all why they were so intent upon emptying the basin Do not forget that Lord Voldemort believes that he alone knows about his Horcruxes Harry made to speak again but t his time Dumbledore raised his hand for silence frowning slightly at the emerald liquid evidently thinking hard Undoubtedly he said finally this potion must act in a way that will prevent me taking the Horcrux It might paralyze me cause me to forget what I am here for create so much pain I am distracted or render me incapable in some other way This being the case Harry it will be your jo b to make sure I keep drinking even if you have to tip the potion into my protesting mouth You understand Their eyes met over the basin each pale face lit with that strange green light Harry did not speak Was this why he had been invited along so that he could forc efeed Dumbledore a potion that might cause him unendurable pain You remember said Dumbledo re the condition on which I brought you with me CHAPTER TWENTYSIX 570 Harry hesitated looking into th e blue eyes that had turned green in the reflected light of the basin But what if You swore did you not to follow any command I gave you Yes but I warned you did I not th at there might be danger Yes said Ha rry but Well then said Dumbledore shaking back his sleeves once more and raising the empty goblet you have my orders Why cant I drink the potion in stead asked Harry desperately Because I am much older much cleverer and much less valuable said Dumbledore Onc e and for all Harry do I have your word that you will do all in your power to make me keep drinking Couldnt Do I have it But Your word Harry I all right but Before Harry could make any further protest Dumbledore lowered the crystal goblet into the potion For a split second Harry hoped that he would not be able to touch the potion with the goblet but the crystal sank into the surface as nothing else had when the glass was full to th e brim Dumbledore lift ed it to his mouth Your good health Harry And he drained the goblet Harr y watched terrified his hands gripping the rim of the basin so ha rd that his fingertips were numb Professor he said anxiously as Dumbledore lowered the empty glass How do you feel THE CAVE 571 Dumbledore shook his head his eyes closed Harry wondered whether he was in pain Dumble dore plunged the glass blindly back into the basin refill ed it and drank once more In silence Dumbledore drank three gobletsful of the potion Then halfway through the fourth goblet he staggered and fell forward against the basin His eyes were still closed his breathing heavy Professor Dumbledore said Ha rry his voice strained Can you hear me Dumbledore did not answer His face was twitching as though he was deeply asleep but dreaming a horrible dream His grip on the goblet was slackening the potion was about to spill from it Harry reached forward and gr asped the crysta l cup holding it steady Professor can you hear me he repeated loudly his voice echoing around the cavern Dumbledore panted and then spoke in a voice Harry did not recognize for he had never heard Dumbledore frightened like this I dont want Dont make me Harry stared into the whitened fa ce he knew so well at the crooked nose and halfmoon spectacles and did not know what to do dont like want to stop moaned Dumbledore You you cant stop Professo r said Harry Youve got to keep drinking remember You told me you had to keep drinking Here Hating himself repulsed by wh at he was doing Harry forced the goblet back toward Dumbledore s mouth and tipped it so that Dumbledore drank the remainde r of the potion inside No he groaned as Harry lo wered the goblet back into the CHAPTER TWENTYSIX 572 basin and refilled it fo r him I dont want to I dont want to Let me go Its all right Professor said Harry his hand shaking Its all right Im here Make it stop make it st op moaned Dumbledore Yes yes thisll make it st op lied Harry He tipped the contents of the goblet into Dumbledores open mouth Dumbledore screamed the noise echoed all around the vast chamber across the dead black water No no no no I cant I can t dont make me I dont want to Its all right Professor its all right said Harry loudly his hands shaking so badly he could ha rdly scoop up th e sixth gobletful of potion the basin was now ha lf empty Nothings happening to you youre safe it isnt real I swear it isnt real take this now take this And obediently Dumbledore drank as though it was an antidote Harry offered him but upon draining the goblet he sank to his knees shaking uncontrollably Its all my fault all my fault he sobbed Please make it stop I know I did wrong oh please make i t s t o p a n d I l l n e v e r n e v e r again This will make it stop Profes sor Harry said his voice cracking as he tipped the seventh glas s of potion into Dumbledores mouth Dumbledore began to cower as though invisible torturers surrounded him his flailing hand al most knocked the refilled goblet from Harrys trembling hands as he moaned Dont hurt them dont hurt them please please its my fault hurt me instead THE CAVE 573 Here drink this drink this youll be all right said Harry desperately and once again Dumbledore obeyed him opening his mouth even as he kept his eyes ti ght shut and shook from head to foot And now he fell forward screaming again hammering his fists upon the ground while Harr y filled the ninth goblet Please please please no not that not that Ill do anything Just drink Professor just drink Dumbledore drank like a child dyin g of thirst but when he had finished he yelled again as thou gh his insides were on fire No more please no more Harry scooped up a tenth gobletful of potion and felt the crystal scrape the bottom of the basin Were nearly there Professor Drink this drink it He supported Dumbledores shoulders and again Dumbledore drained the glass then Harry was on his feet once more refilling the goblet as Dumbledore began to scream in more anguish than ever I want to die I want to die Make it stop make it stop I want to die Drink this Professor Drink this Dumbledore drank and no sooner had he finished than he yelled KILL ME This this one will gasped Har ry Just drink this Itll be over all over Dumbledore gulped at the goblet drained every last drop and then with a great ra ttling gasp rolled over onto his face No shouted Harry who had stood to refill the goblet again instead he dropped the cup into the basin flung himself down CHAPTER TWENTYSIX 574 beside Dumbledore and heaved him over onto his back Dumbledores glasses were askew his mouth agape his eyes closed No said Harry shaking Dumbledore no youre not dead you said it wasnt poison wake up wake up Rennervate he cried his wand pointing at Dumbledores ches t there was a flash of red light but nothing happened Rennervate sir please Dumbledores eyelids flickered Harrys heart leapt Sir are you Water croaked Dumbledore Water panted Harry Yes He leapt to his feet and seized th e goblet he had dropped in the basin he barely registered the gold en locket lying curled beneath it Aguamenti he shouted jabbing th e goblet with his wand The goblet filled with clear water Harry dropped to his knees beside Dumbledore raised his head and brought the glass to his lips but it was empty Dumble dore groaned and began to pant But I had some wait Aguamenti said Harry again pointing his wand at the goblet Once more for a second clear water gleamed within it but as he approached Dumbledores mouth the water vanished again Sir Im trying Im trying sa id Harry desperately but he did not think that Dumbledore could hear him he had rolled onto his side and was drawing great rattl ing breaths that sounded agonizing Aguamenti Aguamenti AGUAMENTI The goblet filled and emptied once more And now Dumbledores breathing was fading His br ain whirling in panic Harry knew instinctively the only way left to get water because Voldemort had planne d it so He flung himself over to the ed ge of the rock and plunged the THE CAVE 575 goblet into the lake bringing it up full to the brim of icy water that did not vanish Sir here Harry yelled and lunging forward he tipped the water clumsily over Dumbledores face It was the best he could do fo r the icy feeling on his arm not holding the cup was not the lingering chill of the water A slimy white hand had gripped his wrist and the creature to whom it belonged was pulling him slowly backward across the rock The surface of the lake was no longer mi rrorsmooth it was churning and everywhere Harry looked white he ads and hands were emerging from the dark water men and women and children with sunken sightless eyes were moving toward the rock an army of the dead rising from the black water Petrificus Totalus yelled Harry struggling to cling to the smooth soaked surface of the isla nd as he pointed his wand at the Inferius that had his arm It released him falling backward into the water with a splash he scrambled to his feet but many more Inferi were already climbing onto the rock their bony hands clawing at its slippery surface th eir blank frosted eyes upon him trailing waterlogged rags sunken faces leering Petrificus Totalus Harry bellowed again backing away as he swiped his wand through the air six or seven of them crumpled but more were coming toward him Impedimenta Incarcerous A few of them stumbled one or two of them bound in ropes but those climbing onto the rock behind them merely stepped over or on the fallen bodies Still slas hing at the air with his wand Harry yelled Sectumsempra SECTUMSEMPRA But though gashes appeared in their sodden rags and their icy skin they had no blood to spill They walked on unfeeling their CHAPTER TWENTYSIX 576 shrunken hands outstretched toward him and as he backed away still farther he felt arms enclos e him from behind thin fleshless arms cold as death and his feet le ft the ground as they lifted him and began to carry him slowly an d surely back to the water and he knew there would be no release that he would be drowned and become one more dead guardian of a fragment of Voldemorts shattered soul But then through the darkness fi re erupted cr imson and gold a ring of fire that surrounded th e rock so that the Inferi holding Harry so tightly stumbled and fa ltered they did not dare pass through the flames to get to the water They dropped Harry he hit the ground slipped on the rock and fell grazing his arms but scrambled back up raising hi s wand and staring around Dumbledore was on his feet again pale as any of the surrounding Inferi but taller than any too the fire dancing in his eyes his wand was raised like a torch and from its tip emanated the flames like a vast lasso encircli ng them all with warmth The Inferi bumped into each othe r attempting blindly to escape the fire in which th ey were enclosed Dumbledore scooped the locket fr om the bottom of the stone basin and stowed it inside his ro bes Wordlessly he gestured to Harry to come to his side Distra cted by the flames the Inferi seemed unaware that their quarry was leaving as Dumbledore led Harry back to the boat the ring of fire movi ng with them around them the bewildered Inferi accompan ying them to the waters edge where they slipped gratefully ba ck into their dark waters Harry who was shaking all over thought for a moment that Dumbledore might not be able to cl imb into the boat he staggered THE CAVE 577 a little as he attempte d it all his efforts seem ed to be going into maintaining the ring of protec tive flame around them Harry seized him and helped him back to his seat Once they were both safely jammed inside again the bo at began to move back across the black water away from the rock still encircled by that ring of fire and it seemed that the Inferi sw arming below them did not dare resurface Sir panted Harry sir I forg ot about fire they were coming at me and I panicked Quite understandable murmured Dumbledore Harry was alarmed to hear how faint his voice was They reached the bank with a little bump and Harry leapt out then turned quickly to help Dumbledore The moment that Dumbledore reached the bank he let his wand hand fall the ring of fire vanished but the Inferi did not em erge again from the water The little boat sank into the water once more clanking and tinkling its chain slithered back into the lake too Dumbledore gave a great sigh and leaned agai nst the cavern wall I am weak he said Dont worry sir said Harry at once anxious about Dumbledores extreme pallor and by his air of exhaustion Dont worry Ill get us back Lean on me sir And pulling Dumbledores uninjured arm around his shoulders Harry guided his headmaster back ar ound the lake bearing most of his weight The protection was after a ll welldesigned said Dumbledore faintly One alone could not have done it You did well very well Harry CHAPTER TWENTYSIX 578 Dont talk now said Harry fearing how slurred Dumbledores voice had become how much his f eet dragged Save your energy sir Well soon be out of here The archway will ha ve sealed again My knife Theres no need I got cut on th e rock said Harry firmly Just tell me where Here Harry wiped his grazed forearm upon the stone Having received its tribute of blood the archway reopened instantly They crossed the outer cave and Harr y helped Dumbledore back into the icy seawater that filled the crevice in the cliff Its going to be all right sir Harry said over and over again more worried by Dumbledores silence than he had been by his weakened voice Were nearly there I can Apparate us both back Dont worry I am not worried Harry said Dumbledore his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water I am with you T W E N T Y S E V E N 579 THE LIGHTNING STR UCK TOWER nce back under the starry sky Harry heaved Dumbledore onto the top of the nearest bo ulder and then to his feet Sodden and shivering Dumbledores weight still upon him Harry concentrated harder than he had ever done upon his destination Hogsmeade Closing his eyes gripping Dumbledores arm as tightly as he could he stepped fo rward into that feeling of horrible compression He knew it had worked before he opened his eyes The smell of salt the sea breeze had gone He and Dumbledore were shivering and dripping in the middle of the dark High Street in Hogsmeade For one horrible moment Harrys imagination showed him more Inferi creeping toward him around the sides of shops but he blinked and saw that nothing was st irring all was still the darkness complete but for a few street lamps and lit upper windows We did it Professor Harry whispered with difficulty he O CHAPTER TWENTYSEVEN 580 suddenly realized that he had a sear ing stitch in his chest We did it We got the Horcrux Dumbledore staggered against him For a moment Harry thought that his inexpert Apparition had thrown Dumbledore off balance then he saw his face pale r and damper than ever in the distant light of a streetlamp Sir are you all right Ive been better said Dumbledore weakly though the corners of his mouth twitched That potion was no health drink And to Harrys horror Dumble dore sank onto the ground Sir its okay sir youre goin g to be all right dont worry He looked around desperately for help but there was nobody to be seen and all he could think was that he must somehow get Dumbledore quickly to the hospital wing We need to get you up to th e school sir Madam Pomfrey No said Dumbledore It is Professor Snape whom I need But I do not think I can walk very far ju st yet Right sir listen Im going to knock on a door find a place you can stay then I can run and get Madam Severus said Dumbledore clearl y I need Severus All right then Snape but Im going to have to leave you for a moment so I can Before Harry could make a move however he heard running footsteps His heart leapt Some body had seen somebody knew they needed help and looking around he saw Madam Rosmerta scurrying down the dark street to ward them on highheeled fluffy slippers wearing a silk dressing gown embroi dered with dragons I saw you Apparate as I was pulling my bedroom curtains THE LIGHTNING STRUCK TOWER 581 Thank goodness thank goodness I couldnt think what to but whats wrong with Albus She came to a halt panting an d stared down wideeyed at Dumbledore Hes hurt said Harry Madam Rosmerta can he come into the Three Broomsticks while I go up to the school and get help for him You cant go up there alone Dont you realize havent you seen If you help me suppor t him said Harry no t listening to her I think we can ge t him inside What has happened asked Dumbledore Rosmerta whats wrong The the Dark Mark Albus And she pointed into the sky in the direction of Hogwarts Dread flooded Harry at the sound of the words He turned and looked There it was hanging in the sk y above the school the blazing green skull with a serpent tongue the mark Death Eaters left behind whenever they had entered a bu ilding wherever they had murdered When did it appear aske d Dumbledore and his hand clenched painfully upon Harrys shoulder as he struggled to his feet Must have been minutes ago it wasnt there when I put the cat out but when I got upstairs We need to return to the castle at once said Dumbledore Rosmerta and though he stagge red a little he seemed wholly in command of the situation we need transport brooms CHAPTER TWENTYSEVEN 582 Ive got a couple behind the bar she said looking very frightened Shall I run and fetch No Harry can do it Harry raised his wand at once Accio Rosmertas Brooms A second later they heard a loud bang as the front door of the pub burst open two brooms had shot out into the street and were racing each other to Harrys side where they stopped dead quivering slightly at waist height Rosmerta please send a message to the Ministry said Dumbledore as he mounted the broom nearest him It might be that nobody within Hogwarts has yet realized anything is wrong Harry put on your Invisibility Cloak Harry pulled his Cloak out of his pocket and threw it over himself before mounting his broom Madam Rosmerta was already tottering back toward her pub as Harry and Dumbledore kicked off from the ground and rose up in to the air As they sped toward the castle Harry glanced sideways at Dumbledore ready to grab him should he fall but the sight of the Dark Mark seemed to have acted upon Dumbledore like a stim ulant He was bent low over his broom his eyes fixed upon the Mark his long silver hair and beard flying behind him on the night air And Harry too looked ahead at the skull and fear swe lled inside him like a venomous bubble compressing his lungs driving all other discomfort from his mind How long had they been away Had Ron Hermione and Ginnys luck run out by now Was it one of them who had caused the Mark to be set over the school or was it Neville or Luna or some other member of the DA An d if it was he was the one THE LIGHTNING STRUCK TOWER 583 who had told them to patrol the corridors he had asked them to leave the safety of their beds Would he be resp onsible again for the death of a friend As they flew over the dark tw isting lane down which they had walked earlier Harry he ard over the whistlin g of the night air in his ears Dumbledore muttering in some strange language again He thought he understood why as he felt his broom shudder when they flew over the boundary wall into the ground s Dumbledore was undoing the enchan tments he himself ha d set around the castle so they could enter at speed The Dark Mark wa s glittering directly above the Astronomy Tower the highest of the castle Did that mean the death had occurred there Dumbledore had already crossed the crenellated ramparts and was dismounting Harry landed next to him seconds later and looked around The ramparts were deserted The door to the spiral staircase that led back into the castle was closed There was no sign of a struggle of a fight to the death of a body What does it mean Harry aske d Dumbledore looking up at the green skull with its serpents tongue glinti ng evilly above them Is it the real Mark Has someon e definitely been Professor In the dim green glow from th e Mark Harry saw Dumbledore clutching at his chest wi th his blackened hand Go and wake Severus said Du mbledore faintly but clearly Tell him what has happened and bring him to me Do nothing else speak to nobody else and do not remove your cloak I shall wait here But You swore to obey me Harry go CHAPTER TWENTYSEVEN 584 Harry hurried over to the door leadin g to the spiral staircase but his hand had only just closed upon the iron ring of the door when he heard running footsteps on the other side He looked around at Dumbledore who gestured him to retreat Harry backed away drawing his wand as he did so The door burst open and somebody erupted through it and shouted Expelliarmus Harrys body became instantly ri gid and immobile and he felt himself fall back against the tower wall propped like an unsteady statue unable to move or speak He could not understand how it had happened Expelliarmus was not a Freezing Charm Then by the light of the Mark he saw Dumbledores wand flying in an arc over the edge of the ramparts and understood Dumbledore had wordlessly immobili zed Harry and the second he had taken to perform the spell had cost him the chance of defending himself Standing against the ramparts very white in the face Dumbledore still showed no sign of pani c or distress He merely looked across at his disa rmer and said Good evening Draco Malfoy stepped forward glancing around quickly to check that he and Dumbledore were alone His eyes fell upon the second broom Who else is here A question I might ask you Or are you acting alone Harry saw Malfoys pale eyes shift back to Dumbledore in the greenish glare of the Mark No he said Ive got backup There are Death Eaters here in your school tonight Well well said Dumbledore as though Malfoy was showing THE LIGHTNING STRUCK TOWER 585 him an ambitious homework project Very good indeed You found a way to let them in did you Yeah said Malfoy who was panting Right under your nose and you never realized Ingenious said Dumbledore Y et forgive me where are they now You seem unsupported They met some of your guards Theyre having a fight down below They wont be long I came on ahead I I ve got a job to do Well then you must get on and do it my dear boy said Dumbledore softly There was silence Harry stood im prisoned within his own invisible paralyzed body staring at the two of them his ears straining to hear sounds of the Death Ea ters distant fight and in front of him Draco Malfoy did nothing but stare at Albus Dumbledore who incredibly smiled Draco Draco you are not a killer How do you know sa id Malfoy at once He seemed to realize how chil dish the words had sounded Harry saw him flush in the Marks greenish light You dont know what Im capabl e of said Malfoy more forcefully You dont know what Ive done Oh yes I do said Dumbledor e mildly You almost killed Katie Bell and Ronald Weasley You have been trying with increasing desperation to kill me all year Forgive me Draco but they have been feeble attemp ts So feeble to be honest that I wonder whether your heart ha s been really in it It has been in it said Malfoy vehemently Ive been working on it all year and tonight CHAPTER TWENTYSEVEN 586 Somewhere in the depths of th e castle below Harry heard a muffled yell Malfoy stiffened an d glanced over his shoulder Somebody is putting up a g ood fight said Dumbledore conversationally But you were saying yes you have managed to introduce Death Eaters into my sc hool which I admit I thought impossible How did you do it But Malfoy said nothing He was still listening to whatever was happening below and se emed almost as para lyzed as Harry was Perhaps you ought to get on with the job alone suggested Dumbledore What if your backup has been thwarted by my guard As you have perhaps realized there are members of the Order of the Phoenix here tonight too And after all you dont really need help I have no wand at the moment I cannot defend myself Malfoy merely st ared at him I see said Dumbledore kindly when Malfoy neither moved nor spoke You are afraid to act until they join you Im not afraid snarled Malfoy though he still made no move to hurt Dumbledore Its yo u who should be scared But why I dont think you will kill me Draco Killing is not nearly as easy as the inno cent believe So tell me while we wait for your friends how did you sm uggle them in he re It seems to have taken you a long time to work out how to do it Malfoy looked as though he was fighting down the urge to shout or to vomit He gulped an d took several deep breaths glaring at Dumbledore his wand pointing directly at the latters heart Then as though he could not help himself he said I had to mend that broken Vanishing Cabinet that no ones used for years The one Montague got lost in last year THE LIGHTNING STRUCK TOWER 587 Aaaah Dumbledores sigh was half a groan He closed his eyes for a moment That was clever There is a pair I take it In Borgin and Burkes said Ma lfoy and they make a kind of passage between them Montague to ld me that when he was stuck in the Hogwarts one he was trapped in limbo but sometimes he could hear what was going on at school and sometimes what was going on in the shop as if the cabinet was traveling between them but he couldnt make anyone hear him In the end he managed to Apparate out even though hed never passed his test He nearly died doing it Everyone thought it was a really good story but I was the only one who realized what it meant even Borgin didnt know I was the one who realized there could be a way into Hogwarts through the cabinets if I fixed the broken one Very good murmured Dumble dore So the Death Eaters were able to pass from Borgin and Burkes into the school to help you A clever plan a very clever plan and as you say right under my nose Yeah said Malfoy who bizarrely seemed to draw courage and comfort from Dumbledores praise Yeah it was But there were times Dumbledore went on werent there when you were not sure you woul d succeed in mending the cabinet And you resorted to crude and badly judged measures such as sending me a cursed necklace th at was bound to reach the wrong hands poisoning mead there was only the slightest chance I might drink Yeah well you still didnt real ize who was behind that stuff did you sneered Malfoy as Dumble dore slid a little down the ramparts the strength in his legs apparently fading and Harry struggled fruitlessly mutely agains t the enchantmen t binding him CHAPTER TWENTYSEVEN 588 As a matter of fact I did said Dumbledore I was sure it was you Why didnt you stop me then Malfoy demanded I tried Draco Professor Snap e has been keeping watch over you on my orders He hasnt been doing your orders he promised my mother Of course that is what he would tell you Draco but Hes a double agent you stupid old man he isnt working for you you just think he is We must agree to differ on that D r a c o I t s o h a p p e n s t h a t I trust Professor Snape Well youre losing your grip then sneered Malfoy Hes been offering me plenty of help wa nting all the gl ory for himself wanting a bit of the action W hat are you doing Did you do the necklace that was stupid it could have blown everything But I havent told him what Ive been doing in the Room of Requirement hes going to wake up tomorrow and itll all be over and he wont be the Dark Lords favo rite anymore hell be nothing compared to me nothing Very gratifying said Dumbledor e mildly We all like appreciation for our own hard work of co urse But you must have had an accomplice all the same someone in Hogsmeade someone who was able to slip Kati e the the aaaah Dumbledore closed his eyes again and nodded as though he was about to fall asleep of cour se Rosmerta How long has she been under the Imperius Curse Got there at last have you Malfoy taunted There was another yell from below rather louder than the last THE LIGHTNING STRUCK TOWER 589 Malfoy looked nervously over his shoulder again then back at Dumbledore who went on So poor Rosmerta was forced to lurk in her own bathroom and pass that necklace to any Hogwarts student who entered the room una ccompanied And the poisoned mead well naturally Rosmerta was able to poison it for you before she sent the bottle to Slugho rn believing that it was to be my Christmas present Yes ve ry neat very neat Poor Mr Filch would not of course t hink to check a bottle of Rosmertas Tell me how have you been communicating with Rosmerta I thought we had all methods of communication in and out of the school monitored Enchanted coins said Malfoy as though he was compelled to keep talking though his wand ha nd was shaking badly I had one and she had the other and I could send her messages Isnt that the secret method of communication the group that called themselves Dumbledores Army used last year asked Dumbledore His voice was light and conversational but Harry saw him slip an inch lower down th e wall as he said it Yeah I got the idea from them said Malfoy with a twisted smile I got the idea of pois oning the mead from the Mudblood Granger as well I heard her talking in the library about Filch not recognizing potions Please do not use that offensive word in front of me said Dumbledore Malfoy gave a harsh laugh You care about me saying Mudblood when Im abou t to kill you Yes I do said Dumbledore and Harry saw his feet slide a little on the floor as he struggled to remain up right But as for being CHAPTER TWENTYSEVEN 590 about to kill me Draco you have had several long minutes now we are quite alone I am more defenseless than you can have dreamed of finding me and stil l you have not acted Malfoys mouth contorted involuntar ily as though he had tasted something very bitter Now about tonight Dumbledore went on I am a little puzzled about how it happened You knew that I had left the school But of course he answ ered his own question Rosmerta saw me leaving she tipped you of f using your ingenious coins Im sure Thats right said Malfoy But she said you were just going for a drink youd be back Well I certainly did have a drink and I came back after a fashion mumbled Dumbledore So you decided to spring a trap for me We decided to put the Dark Ma rk over the tower and get you to hurry up here to see whod be en killed said Malfoy And it worked Well yes and no said Dumbledore But am I to take it then that nobody has been murdered Someones dead said Malfoy and his voice seemed to go up an octave as he said it One of your people I dont know who it was dark I stepped over the body I was supposed to be waiting up here when you got back only your Phoenix lot got in the way Yes they do that said Dumbledore There was a bang and shouts from below louder than ever it sounded as though people were fighting on th e actual spiral staircase that led to where Dumbledor e Malfoy and Harry stood and THE LIGHTNING STRUCK TOWER 591 Harrys heart thundered unheard in his invisibl e chest Someone was dead Malfoy had stepped over the body but who was it There is little time one way or another said Dumbledore So let us discuss your options Draco My options said Malfoy loudly I m s t a n d i n g h e r e w i t h a wand Im about to kill you My dear boy let us have no more pretense about that If you were going to kill me you woul d have done it when you first disarmed me you would not have stoppe d for this pleasant chat about ways and means I havent got any options sa id Malfoy and he was suddenly white as Dumbledore Ive got to do it Hell kill me Hell kill my whole family I appreciate the difficulty of your position said Dumbledore Why else do you think I have no t confronted you before now Because I knew that you would have been murdered if Lord Voldemort realized that I suspected you Malfoy winced at the sound of the name I did not dare speak to you of the mission with which I knew you had been entrusted in case he used Legilimency against you continued Dumbledore But now at last we can speak plainly to each other No harm has been done you have hurt nobody though you are very lucky that your unintentional victims survived I can help you Draco No you cant said Malfoy his wand hand shaking very badly indeed Nobody can He told me to do it or he ll kill me Ive got no choice CHAPTER TWENTYSEVEN 592 Come over to the right side Dr aco and we can hide you more completely than you can possibly im agine What is more I can send members of the Order to your mother tonight to hide her likewise Your father is safe at the moment in Azkaban When the time comes we can protect him too Come over to the right side Draco you are not a killer Malfoy stared at Dumbledore But I got this far didnt I he said slowly They thought Id die in the attempt but Im here and youre in my power Im the one with the wand Yo ure at my me rcy No Draco said Dumbledore quietly It is my mercy and not yours that matters now Malfoy did not speak His mouth was open his wand hand still trembling Harry thought he saw it drop by a fraction But suddenly footsteps were thundering up the stairs and a second later Malfoy was buffeted out of the way as four people in black robes burst through the door onto the ramparts Still paralyzed his eyes staring unblinking ly Harry gazed in terror upon four strangers It seemed the Deat h Eaters had won the fight below A lumpylooking man with an odd lopsided leer gave a wheezy giggle Dumbledore cornered he said an d he turned to a stocky little woman who looked as though she could be his sister and who was grinning eagerly Dumbledore wandless Dumbledore alone Well done Draco well done Good evening Amycus said Du mbledore calmly as though welcoming the man to a tea party And youve brought Alecto too Charming THE LIGHTNING STRUCK TOWER 593 The woman gave an angry little titter Think your little jokesll help you on your deathb ed then she jeered Jokes No no these are manners replied Dumbledore Do it said the stranger standi ng nearest to Harry a big rangy man with matted gray hair an d whiskers whos e black Death Eaters robes looked uncomfortably tight He had a voice like none that Harry had ever heard a rasp ing bark of a voice Harry could smell a powerful mixture of dirt sweat and unmistakably of blood coming from him His filthy hands had long yellowish nails Is that you Fenrir asked Dumbledore Thats right rasped the other Pleased to see me Dumbledore No I cannot say that I am Greyback grinned showing poin ted teeth Blood trickled down his chin and he licked hi s lips slowly obscenely But you know how much I like kids Dumbledore Am I to take it that you are attacking even without the full moon now This is most unusual You have developed a taste for human flesh that cannot be satisfied once a month Thats right said Fenrir Grey back Shocks you that does it Dumbledore Frightens you Well I cannot pretend it does no t disgust me a little said Dumbledore And yes I am a little shocked that Draco here invited you of all people into the sc hool where his friends live I didnt breathed Malfoy He was not looking at Fenrir he did not seem to want to even glance at him I didnt know he was going to come I wouldnt want to miss a trip to Hogwarts Dumbledore rasped Greyback Not when there ar e throats to be ripped out Delicious delicious CHAPTER TWENTYSEVEN 594 And he raised a yellow fingernail and picked at his front teeth leering at Dumbledore I could do you for afters Dumbledore No said the fourth Death Eater sharply He had a heavy brutallooking face Weve got orde rs Dracos got to do it Now Draco and quickly Malfoy was showing less resolution than ever He looked terrified as he stared into Dumbledo res face which was even paler and rather lower than usual as he had slid so far down the rampart wall Hes not long for this world anyway if you ask me said the lopsided man to the accompanim ent of his sisters wheezing giggles Look at him whats happened to you then Dumby Oh weaker resistance slower reflexes Amycus said Dumbledore Old age in short One day perhaps it will happen to you if you are lucky Whats that mean then whats that mean yelled the Death Eater suddenly violent Always the same werent yeh Dumby talking and doing nothing nothing I dont even know why the Dark Lords bothering to kill yer Come on Draco do it But at that moment there were re newed sounds of scuffling from below and a voice shouted Theyve blocked the stairs Reducto REDUCTO Harrys heart leapt So these four had not eliminated all opposition but merely broken through th e fight to the top of the tower and by the sound of it crea ted a barrier behind them Now Draco quickly said th e brutalfaced man angrily But Malfoys hand was shaking so badly that he could barely aim THE LIGHTNING STRUCK TOWER 595 Ill do it snarled Fenrir moving toward Dumbledore with his hands outstretched his teeth bared I said no shouted the brutalf aced man there was a flash of light and the werewolf was blasted out of the way he hit the ramparts and staggered looking furi ous Harrys hear t was hammering so hard it seemed impossible that nobody could hear him standing there imprisoned by Dumbledores spell if he could only move he could aim a curse from under the cloak Draco do it or stand aside so one of us screeched the woman but at that precise moment the door to the ramparts burst open once more and there stood Snap e his wand clutched in his hand as his black eyes swept the scene from Dumbledore slumped against the wall to the four De ath Eaters including the enraged werewolf and Malfoy Weve got a problem Snape said the lumpy Amycus whose eyes and wand were fixed alike up on Dumbledore the boy doesnt seem able But somebody else had spoken Snapes name quite softly Severus The sound frightened Harry beyo nd anything he had experienced all evening Fo r the first time Dumb ledore was pleading Snape said nothing but walked forward and pushed Malfoy roughly out of the way The three Death Eaters fell back without a word Even the werewolf seemed cowed Snape gazed for a moment at Du mbledore and there was revulsion and hatred etched in the harsh lines of his face Severus please Snape raised his wand and pointe d it directly at Dumbledore CHAPTER TWENTYSEVEN 596 Avada Kedavra A jet of green light shot from the end of Snapes wand and hit Dumbledore squarely in the chest Harrys scream of horror never left him silent and unmoving he was forced to watch as Dumbledore was blasted into the air For a split second he seemed to hang suspended beneath the shining skull and then he fell slowly backward like a great rag doll over the battlements and out of sight T W E N T Y E I G H T 597 FLIGHT OF THE PRINCE arry felt as though he too were hurtling through space it had not happened It could not have happened Out of here quickly said Snape He seized Malfoy by the scru ff of the neck and forced him through the door ahead of the rest Greyback and the squat brother and sister followed the latter both panting excitedly As they vanished through the door Harry realized he could move again What was now holding him paralyzed against the wall was not magic but horror and shock He threw the Invi sibility Cloak aside as the brutalfaced Death Eater last to le ave the tower top was disappearing through the door Petrificus Totalus The Death Eater buckled as though hit in the back with something solid and fell to the ground rigid as a waxw ork but he had barely hit the floor when Harry wa s clambering over him and running down the darkened staircase H CHAPTER TWENTYEIGHT 598 Terror tore at Harrys heart He had to get to Dumbledore and he had to catch Snape Somehow the two things were linked He could reverse wh at had happened if he had them both together Dumbledore could not have died He leapt the last ten steps of the spiral staircase and stopped where he landed his wa nd raised The dimly li t corridor was full of dust half the ceiling seemed to have fallen in and a battle was raging before him but even as he attempted to make out who was fighting whom he heard the hated voice shout Its over time to go and saw Snape disappearing around the corner at the far end of the corridor he and Malfoy seemed to have forced their way through the fight unscathed As Harry plunged after them one of the fighters detached themselves fr om the fray and flew at him It was the werewolf Fenrir He was on top of Harry before Harry could raise his wand Harry fell ba ckward with filthy matted hair in his face the stench of swea t and blood filling his nose and mouth hot greedy breath at his throat Petrificus Totalus Harry felt Fenrir collapse agai nst him with a stupendous effort he pushed the werewolf off and onto the floor as a jet of green light came flying toward him he ducked and ran headfirst into the fight His feet met something squa shy and slippery on the floor and he stumbled There were two bodies lying there lying facedown in a pool of blood but there was no time to investigate Harry now saw red hair flying like flames in front of him Ginny was locked in combat with the lumpy Death Ea ter Amycus who was throwing hex after hex at her while she dodg ed them Amycus was giggling enjoying the sport Crucio Crucio you cant dance forever pretty FLIGHT OF THE PRINCE 599 Impedimenta yelled Harry His jinx hit Amycus in the chest He gave a piglike squeal of pain was lifted off his feet and sla mmed into the opposite wall slid down it and fell out of sight behi nd Ron Professor McGonagall and Lupin each of whom was bat tling a separate Death Eater Beyond them Harry saw Tonks fighti ng an enormous blond wizard who was sending curses flying in al l directions so that they ricocheted off the walls around them cracking stone shattering the nearest window Harry where did you come from Ginny cried but there was no time to answer her He put hi s head down and sprinted forward narrowly avoiding a bl ast that erupted over his head showering them all in bits of wall Snape mu st not escape he must catch up with Snape Take that shouted Professor McGonagall and Harry glimpsed the female Death Eater Alecto sprinting away down the corridor with her arms over her head her brother right behind her He launched himself after them but his foot caught on something and next moment he was lying across someones legs Looking around he saw Nevilles pale round face flat against the floor Neville are you Mall right muttered Neville who was clutching his stomach Harry Snape n Malf oy ran past I know Im on it said Harry aiming a hex from the floor at the enormous blond Death Eater who was causing most of the chaos The man gave a howl of pain as the spell hit him in the face He wheeled around staggered and then pounded away after the brother and sister Harry scrambled up from the floor and began to sprint along the corridor ignoring the bangs issuing from behind CHAPTER TWENTYEIGHT 600 him the yells of the others to come back and the mute call of the figures on the ground whose fa te he did not yet know He skidded around the corner his trainers slippery with blood Snape had an immense head start Was it possible th at he had already entered the cabinet in the R oom of Requirement or had the Order made steps to secure it to prevent the Death Eaters retreating that way He could hear no thing but his own pounding feet his own hammering heart as he sprinted along the next empty corridor but then spotted a bloody foot print that showed at least one of the fleeing Death Eaters was heading toward the front doors perhaps the Room of Requir ement was indeed blocked He skidded around another corner and a curse flew past him he dived behind a suit of armor that exploded He saw the brother and sister running down the marble stai rcase ahead and aimed jinxes at them but merely hit several bewigged witches in a portrait on the landing who ran scre eching into neighborin g paintings As he leapt the wreckage of armor Harry heard more shouts and screams other people within the castle seemed to have awoken He pelted toward a shortcut hoping to overtake the brother and sister and close in on Snape and Malfoy who must surely have reached the grounds by now Reme mbering to leap the vanishing step halfway down the concealed staircase he burst through a tapestry at the bottom and out in to a corridor where a number of bewildered and pajamaclad Hufflepuffs stood Harry We heard a noise and someone said something about the Dark Mark began Ernie Macmillan Out of the way yelled Harry knocking two boys aside as he sprinted toward the landing and down the remainder of the marble staircase The oak front doors ha d been blasted open there were FLIGHT OF THE PRINCE 601 smears of blood on th e flagstones and seve ral terrified students stood huddled against th e walls one or two still cowering with their arms over their faces Th e giant Gryffindor hourglass had been hit by a curse and the rubies within were still falling with a loud rattle onto the flagstones below Harry flew across the entrance hall and out into the dark grounds He could just make out three figu res racing across the lawn heading for the gates beyond which they could Disapparate by the looks of them the huge blond Death Eate r and some way ahead of him Snape and Malfoy The cold night air ripp ed at Harrys lungs as he tore after them he saw a flash of light in the distance that momentarily silhouetted his quarry He did not know what it was but continued to run not yet near enough to get a good aim with a curse Another flash shouts retaliatory jets of light and Harry understood Hagrid had emerged from his cabin and was trying to stop the Death Eaters escaping and th ough every breath seemed to shred his lungs and the stitch in his chest was like fire Harry sped up as an unbidden voice in his head said not Hagrid not Hagrid too Something caught Harry hard in the small of the back and he fell forward his face smacking the ground blood pouring out of both nostrils He knew even as he rolled over his wand ready that the brother and sister he had ov ertaken using his shortcut were closing in behind him Impedimenta he yelled as he rolled over again crouching close to the dark ground and miraculously his jinx hit one of them who stumbled and fell tripping up the other Harry leapt to his feet and sprinted on after Snape CHAPTER TWENTYEIGHT 602 And now he saw the vast outline of Hagrid illuminated by the light of the crescent moon revealed suddenly behind clouds the blond Death Eater was aiming curs e after curse at the gamekeeper but Hagrids immense st rength and the tough ened skin he had inherited from his giantess mother seemed to be protecting him Snape and Malfoy however were st ill running they would soon be beyond the gates ab le to Disapparate Harry tore past Hagrid and his opponent took aim at Snapes back and yelled Stupefy He missed the jet of red light soared past Snapes head Snape shouted Run Draco and turned Twenty yards apart he and Harry looked at each other before ra ising their wands simultaneously Cruc But Snape parried the curse kn ocking Harry backward off his feet before he could complete it Harry rolled over and scrambled back up again as the huge De ath Eater behind him yelled Incendio Harry heard an explosive ba ng and a dancing orange light spilled over all of them Ha grids house was on fire Fangs in there yer evil Hagrid bellowed Cruc yelled Harry for the second time aiming for the figure ahead illuminated in the dancing firelight but Snape blocked the spell again Harry could see him sneering No Unforgivable Curses from you Potter he shouted over the rushing of the flames Hagrids yells and the wild yelping of the trapped Fang You havent got the nerve or the ability Incarc Harry roared but Snape deflected the spell with an almost lazy flick of his arm Fight back Harry screamed at him Fight back you cowardly FLIGHT OF THE PRINCE 603 Coward did you call me Potter shouted Snape Your father would never attack me unless it wa s four on one what would you call him I wonder Stupe Blocked again and again and agai n until you learn to keep your mouth shut and your mind closed Potter sneered Snape deflecting the curse once more Now come he shouted at the huge Death Eater behind Harry It is ti me to be gone before the Ministry turns up Impedi But before he could finish this jinx excruciating pain hit Harry he keeled over in the grass Someone was screaming he would surely die of this agony Snape was going to torture him to death or madness No roared Snapes voice and th e pain stopped as suddenly as it had started Harry lay curled on the dark grass clutching his wand and panting somewhere overhead Snape was shouting Have you forgotten our orders Potter belongs to the Dark Lord we are to le ave him Go Go And Harry felt the ground shudder under his face as the brother and sister and the enormous Deat h Eater obeyed running toward the gates Harry uttered an inarticulate yell of rage In that instant he cared not whether he lived or died Pushing himself to his feet again he staggered blindly toward Snape the man he now hated as much as he hated Voldemort himself Sectum Snape flicked his wand and the cu rse was repelled yet again but Harry was mere feet away now and he could see Snapes face clearly at last He was no longer sneering or jeering the blazing flames CHAPTER TWENTYEIGHT 604 showed a face full of rage Mustering all his powers of concentration Harry thought Levi No Potter screamed Snape There was a loud BANG and Harry was soaring backward hittin g the ground hard again and this time his wand flew out of his hand He could hear Hagrid yelling and Fang howling as Snap e closed in and looked down on him where he lay wandless and defenseless as Dumbledore had been Snapes pale face illuminate d by the flaming cabin was suffused with hatred just as it had been before he had cursed Dumbledore You dare use my own spells against me Potter It was I who invented them I the HalfBlood Prince And youd turn my inventions on me like your filthy father would you I dont think so no Harry had dived for his wand Snape shot a hex at it and it flew feet away into the dark ness and out of sight Kill me then panted Harry who felt no fear at all but only rage and contempt Kill me like you killed him you coward DONT screamed Snape and his face was suddenly demented inhuman as though he wa s in as much pain as the yelping howling dog stuck in the burning house behind them CALL ME COWARD And he slashed at the air Harry felt a whitehot whiplike something hit him across the face and was slammed backward into the ground Spots of light burst in fr ont of his eyes and for a moment all the breath seemed to have gone from his body then he heard a rush of wings above him and so mething enormous obscured the stars Buckbeak had flown at Snap e who staggered backward as the razorsharp claws slashed at him As Harry raised himself into a sitFLIGHT OF THE PRINCE 605 ting position his head still swimming from its last contact with the ground he saw Snape running as hard as he could the enormous beast flapping behind him and sc reeching as Harry had never heard him screech Harry struggled to his feet lo oking around groggily for his wand hoping to give chase again but even as his fingers fumbled in the grass discarding twigs he knew it would be too late and sure enough by the time he had located his wand he turned only to see the hippogriff circling the gates Snape had managed to Disapparate just beyond the schools boundaries Hagrid muttered Harry still dazed looking around HAGRID He stumbled toward the burning house as an enormous figure emerged from out of the flames ca rrying Fang on his back With a cry of thankfulness Ha rry sank to his knees he was shaking in every limb his body ached all over and his breath came in painful stabs Yeh all righ Harry Yeh all ri gh Speak ter me Harry Hagrids huge hairy face was swimming above Harry blocking out the stars Harry could smell burnt wood and dog hair he put out a hand and felt Fangs reassu ringly warm and alive body quivering beside him Im all right panted Harry Are you Course I am take mo ren that ter finish me Hagrid put his hands under Harr ys arms and raised him up with such force that Harrys feet momentarily left the ground before Hagrid set him upright again He could see blood trickling down Hagrids cheek from a deep cut under one eye which was swelling rapidly CHAPTER TWENTYEIGHT 606 We should put out your house said Harry the charms Aguamenti Knew it was summat like that mumbled Hagrid and he raised a smoldering pink fl owery umbrella and said Aguamenti A jet of water flew out of the umbrella tip Harry raised his wand arm which felt like lead and murmured Aguamenti too Together he and Hagrid poured water on the house until the last flame was extinguished Snot too bad said Hagrid hop efully a few minutes later looking at the smoking wreck Nothi n Dumbledore won be able to put righ Harry felt a searing pain in hi s stomach at the sound of the name In the silence an d the stillness horror rose inside him Hagrid I was bindin up a couple o bowtruckle legs when I heard em comin said Hagrid sadly stil l staring at his wrecked cabin Theyllve bin burnt ter twigs poor li ttle things Hagrid But what happened Harry I jus saw them Death Eaters runnin down from the castle but what the ruddy hell was Snape doin with em Wheres he gone was he chasin them He Harry cleared his throat it was dry from panic and the smoke Hagrid he killed Killed said Hagrid loudly staring down at Harry Snape killed Whatre yeh on abou Harry Dumbledore said Harry Sna pe killed Dumbledore Hagrid simply looked at him the little of his face that could be seen completely blank uncomprehending Dumbledore wha Harry FLIGHT OF THE PRINCE 607 Hes dead Snape ki lled him Don say that said Hagrid roughly Snape kill Dumbledore don be stup id Harry Whas made yeh say tha I saw it happen Yeh couldn have I saw it Hagrid Hagrid shook his head his expression was disbelieving but sympathetic and Harry knew that Hagr id thought he had sustained a blow to the head that he was confused perhaps by the aftereffects of a jinx What musta happened was Dumb ledore musta told Snape ter go with them Death Eaters Hagr id said confidently I suppose hes gotta keep his cover Look le ts get yeh back up ter the school Come on Harry Harry did not attempt to argue or explain He was still shaking uncontrollably Hagrid would find out soon enough too soon As they directed their steps back toward the castle Harry saw that many of its windows were lit now He could imagine clearly the scenes inside as people moved from room to room telling each other that Death Eaters had got in that the Mark was shining over Hogwarts that somebody must have been killed The oak front doors stood open ahead of them light flooding out onto the drive and the lawn Slowly uncertainly dressinggowned people were creeping down the step s looking around nervously for some sign of the Death Eaters wh o had fled into the night Harrys eyes however were fixed upon the ground at the foot of the tallest tower He imagined that he could see a black huddled mass lying in the grass there though he was really too far away to see anything of the sort Even as he stared wordle ssly at the place where he thought CHAPTER TWENTYEIGHT 608 Dumbledores body must lie howeve r he saw people beginning to move toward it Whatre they all lookin at said Hagrid as he and Harry approached the castle front Fang keep ing as close as he could to their ankles Whas tha lyin on the grass Hagrid added sharply heading now toward the foot of the Astronomy Tower where a small crowd was congrega ting See it Harry Ri gh at the foot o the tower Under where the Mark Blimey yeh don think someone got thrown Hagrid fell silent the thought ap parently too horrible to express aloud Harry walked alongside hi m feeling the aches and pains in his face and his legs where the vari ous hexes of the last half hour had hit him though in an oddly detached way as though somebody near him was suffering them What was real and inescapable was the awful pressing feel ing in his chest He and Hagrid moved dreamlike through the murmuring crowd to the very front where th e dumbstruck students and teachers had left a gap Harry heard Hagrids moan of pa in and shock but he did not stop he walked slowly forward until he reached the place where Dumbledore lay and crouched dow n beside him He had known there was no hope from the moment that the full BodyBind Curse Dumbledore had placed upon him li fted known that it could have happened only because its caster was dead but ther e was still no preparation for seeing him here sp readeagled broken the greatest wizard Harry had ever or would ever meet Dumbledores eyes were closed bu t for the strange angle of his arms and legs he might have been sleeping Harry reached out straightened the halfmoon specta cles upon the crooked nose and FLIGHT OF THE PRINCE 609 wiped a trickle of blood from the mouth with his own sleeve Then he gazed down at the wise old fa ce and tried to absorb the enormous and incomprehensible trut h that never again would Dumbledore speak to him never again could he help The crowd murmured behind Harry After what seemed like a long time he became aware that he was kneeling upon something hard and looked down The locket they had managed to steal so many hours before had fallen out of Dumbledores pocket It had opened perhaps due to the force with which it hit the gr ound And although he could not feel more shock or horror or sadness than he felt already Harry knew as he picked it up that there was something wrong He turned the locket over in his hands This was neither as large as the locket he remembered seeing in the Pensieve nor were there any markings upon it no sign of the ornate S that was supposed to be Slytherins mark Moreover there was nothing inside but for a scrap of folded parchment wedged tightly into the place where a portrait should have been Automatically without really thinking about what he was doing Harry pulled out the fragment of pa rchment opened it and read by the light of the many wands that had now been lit behind him To the Dark Lord I know I will be dead long before you read this but I want you to know that it was I who discovered your secret I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can I face death in the hope that when you meet your match you will be mortal once more RAB CHAPTER TWENTYEIGHT 610 Harry neither knew nor cared wh at the message meant Only one thing mattered This was not a Horcrux Dumbledore had weakened himself by drinking th at terrible potion for nothing Harry crumpled the parchment in his hand and his eyes burned with tears as behind him Fang began to howl T W E N T Y N I N E 611 THE PHOENIX LAMENT mere Harry No Yeh can stay here Harry Come on now No He did not want to leave Dumble dores side he did not want to move anywhere Hagrids hand on his shoulder was trembling Then another voice said Harry come on A much smaller and warmer ha nd had enclosed his and was pulling him upward He obeyed its pressure without really thinking about it Only as he walked blin dly back through the crowd did he realize from a trace of flowery sc ent on the air that it was Ginny who was leading him back into the castle Incomprehensible voices battered him sobs and shouts an d wails stabbed the night but Harry and Ginny walked on back up the steps into the entrance hall Faces swam on the edges of Ha rrys vision people were peering C CHAPTER TWENTYNINE 612 at him whispering wondering and Gryffindor rubies glistened on the floor like drops of blood as they made their way toward the marble staircase Were going to the hospital wing said Ginny Im not hurt said Harry Its McGonagalls orders sa id Ginny Everyones up there Ron and Hermione and Lu pin and everyone Fear stirred in Harrys chest agai n He had forgotten the inert figures he had left behind Ginny who else is dead Dont worry none of us But the Dark Mark Malfoy said he stepped over a body He stepped over Bill but it s all right hes alive There was something in her voic e however that Harry knew boded ill Are you sure Of course Im sure hes a a bit of a mess thats all Greyback attacked him Madam Pomfre y says he wont wont look the same anymore Ginnys voice trembled a little We dont really know what the aftereffects will be I mean Greyback being a werewolf but not transformed at the time But the others There were other bodies on the ground Neville and Professor Flitwick are both hurt but Madam Pomfrey says theyll be all right And a Death Eaters dead he got hit by a Killing Curse that huge blond one was firing off everywhere Harry if we hadnt had your Felix potion I think wed all have been killed but everything seem ed to just miss us THE PHOENIX LAMENT 613 They had reached the hospital wing Pushing open the doors Harry saw Neville lying apparently asleep in a bed near the door Ron Hermione Luna Tonks and Lupin were gathered around another bed near the far end of the ward At the sound of the doors opening they all looked up He rmione ran to Harry and hugged him Lupin moved forward too looking anxious Are you all right Harry Im fine Hows Bill Nobody answered Harry looked over Hermiones shoulder and saw an unrecognizable face lying on Bills pillow so badly slashed and ripped that he looked grotes que Madam Pomfrey was dabbing at his wounds with some harshsmelling green ointment Harry remembered how Snape had mended Malfoys Sectumsempra wounds so easily with his wand Cant you fix them with a char m or something he asked the matron No charm will work on these said Madam Pomfrey Ive tried everything I know but there is no cure for werewolf bites But he wasnt bitten at the full moon said Ron who was gazing down into his brothers face as though he could somehow force h i m t o m e n d j u s t b y s t a r i n g G r e y b a c k h a d n t t r a n s f o r m e d s o surely Bill wont be a a real He looked uncertainly at Lupin No I dont think that Bill will be a true werewolf said Lupin but that does not mean that th ere wont be some contamination Those are cursed wounds They ar e unlikely ever to heal fully and and Bill might have some wolfish characteristics from now on CHAPTER TWENTYNINE 614 Dumbledore might know someth ing thatd wo rk though Ron said Where is he Bill fo ught those maniacs on Dumbledores orders Dumbledore owes him he cant leave him in this state Ron Dumbledores dead said Ginny No Lupin looked wildly from Ginny to Harry as though hoping the latter might contradict her but when Harry did not Lupin collapsed into a chair beside Bills bed his hands over his face Harry had never seen Lupin lo se control before he felt as though he was intruding upon something private indecent He turned away and caught Rons eye instead exchanging in silence a look that confirmed what Ginny had said How did he die wh ispered Tonks How did it happen Snape killed him said Harry I was there I saw it We arrived back on the Astronomy Tower because thats where the Mark was Dumbledore was ill he was weak but I think he realized it was a trap when we heard footsteps running up the stairs He immobilized me I couldnt do anything I was under the Invisibility Cloak and then Malfoy came through the door and disarmed him Hermione clapped her hands to her mouth and Ron groaned Lunas mouth trembled more Death Eaters arrived and then Snape and Snape did it The Avada Kedavra Harry couldnt go on Madam Pomfrey burst in to tears Nobody paid her any attention except Ginny who wh ispered Shh Listen Gulping Madam Pomfrey pressed he r fingers to her mouth her eyes wide Somewhere out in the darkness a phoenix was singing in a way Harry had never heard befo re a stricken lament of terriTHE PHOENIX LAMENT 615 ble beauty And Harry felt as he had felt about phoenix song before that the music was inside him not without It was his own grief turned magically to song th at echoed across the grounds and through the castle windows How long they all stood there listening he did not know nor why it seemed to ease their pain a little to listen to the sound of their mourning but it felt like a long time later that the hospital door opened again and Professor McGonagall entered the ward Like all the rest she bore marks of the recent battle There were grazes on her face and her robes were ripped Molly and Arthur are on their way she said and the spell of the music was broken Everyone rous ed themselves as though coming out of trances turning again to look at Bill or else to rub their own eyes shake their heads Har ry what happened According to Hagrid you were with Professo r Dumbledore when he when it happened He says Professor Sn ape was involved in some Snape killed Dumbledo re said Harry She stared at him for a mom ent then swayed alarmingly Madam Pomfrey who seemed to ha ve pulled herself together ran forward conjuring a chair from thin air which she pushed under McGonagall Snape repeated McGonagall fa intly falling into the chair We all wondered but he trusted always Snape I cant believe it Snape was a highly accomplished Occlumens said Lupin his voice uncharacteristically hars h We always knew that But Dumbledore swore he was on our side whispered Tonks I always thought Dumbledore mu st know something about Snape that we didnt CHAPTER TWENTYNINE 616 He always hinted that he had an ironclad reason for trusting Snape muttered Professor McGona gall now dabbing at the corners of her leaking eyes with a tartanedged handkerchief I mean with Snapes histo ry of course people were bound to wonder but Dumbledore told me explicitly that Snapes repentance was absolutely genuine Woul dnt hear a word against him Id love to know what Snape to ld him to convince him said Tonks I know said Harry and they al l turned to look at him Snape passed Voldemort the information that made Voldemort hunt down my mum and dad Then Snape told Dumbledore he hadnt realized what he was doing he was really sorry hed done it sorry that they were dead They all stared at him And Dumbledore believed that said Lupin incredulously Dumbledore believed Snape was sorry James was dead Snape hated James And he didnt think my mother was worth a damn either said Harry because she was Muggleborn Mudblood he called her Nobody asked how Harry knew this All of them seemed to be lost in horrified shock trying to digest the monstrous truth of what had happened This is all my fault said Pr ofessor McGonagall suddenly She looked disoriented twisting her wet handkerchief in her hands My fault I sent Filius to fetch Snape tonight I actually sent for him to come and help us If I hadn t alerted Snape to what was going on he might never have joined forces with the Death Eaters I THE PHOENIX LAMENT 617 dont think he knew they were ther e before Filius to ld him I dont think he knew they were coming It isnt your fault Minerva sa id Lupin firmly We all wanted more help we were glad to thin k Snape was on hi s way So when he arrived at the fight he joined in on the Death Eaters side asked Harry who want ed every detail of Snapes duplicity and infamy feverishly collec ting more reasons to hate him to swear vengeance I dont know exactly how it happened sa id Professor McGonagall distractedly Its all so confu sing Dumbledore had told us that he would be leaving the scho ol for a few hours and that we were to patrol the corridors just in case Remus Bill and Nymphadora were to join us and so we patrolled All seemed quiet Every secret passageway ou t of the school was covered We knew nobody could fly in There were powerful enchantments on every entrance into the castle I still dont know how the Death Eaters can possibly have entered I do said Harry and he explai ned briefly about the pair of Vanishing Cabinets and the magi cal pathway they formed So they got in through the Room of Requirement Almost against his will he glan ced from Ron to Hermione both of whom looked devastated I messed up Harry said Ron blea kly We did like you told us We checked the Marauders Map and we couldnt see Malfoy on it so we thought he must be in the Room of Requirement so me Ginny and Neville went to keep watch on it but Malfoy got past us He came out of the room abou t an hour after we started CHAPTER TWENTYNINE 618 keeping watch said Ginny He wa s on his own clutching that awful shriveled arm His Hand of Glory said Ron Gives light only to the holder remember Anyway Ginny went on h e must have been checking whether the coast was clear to let the Death Eaters out because the moment he saw us he threw somet hing into the air and it all went pitchblack Peruvian Instant Darkness Powd er said Ron bitterly Fred and Georges Im going to be havi ng a word with them about who they let buy th eir products We tried everything Lumos In cendio said Ginny Nothing would penetrate the darkness all we could do was grope our way out of the corridor again and me anwhile we could hear people rushing past us Obviously Malfoy could see because of that hand thing and was guiding them but we didnt dare use any curses or anything in case we hit each other and by the time wed reached a corridor that was li ght theyd gone Luckily said Lupin hoarsely Ron Ginny and Neville ran into us almost immediately and told us what had happened We found the Death Eaters minutes late r heading in the direction of the Astronomy Tower Malfoy obvi ously hadnt expected more people to be on the watch he seemed to have exhausted his supply of Darkness Powder at any rate A fight broke out they scattered and we gave chase One of them Gibbon broke away and headed up the tower stairs To set off the Mark asked Harry He must have done yes they mu st have arranged that before they left the Room of Requirement said Lupin But I dont think THE PHOENIX LAMENT 619 Gibbon liked the idea of waitin g up there alone for Dumbledore because he came running back dow nstairs to rejoin the fight and was hit by a Killing Curse that just missed me So if Ron was watching the Room of Requirement with Ginny and Neville said Harry turnin g to Hermione were you Outside Snapes office yes whispered Hermione her eyes sparkling with tears with Luna We hung around for ages outside it and nothing happened We didnt know what was going on upstairs Ron had taken the map It was nearly midnight when Professor Flitwick came sprinting down into the dungeons He was shouting about Death Eaters in the castle I dont think he really registered that Luna and I were th ere at all he just burst his way into Snapes office and we heard him saying that Snape had to go back with him and help and then we heard a loud thump and Snape came hurtling out of his room and he saw us and and What Harry urged her I was so stupid Harry said Hermione in a highpitched whisper He said Professor Flitwick had collapsed and that we should go and take care of him while he while he went to help fight the Death Eaters She covered her face in shame and continued to talk into her fingers so that her voice was mu ffled We went into his office to see if we could help Professor Flitwick and found him unconscious on the floor and oh its so obvious now Snape must have Stupefied Flitwick bu t we didnt realize Harry we didnt realize we just let Snape go Its not your fault said Lupi n firmly Hermione had you not obeyed Snape and got out of the way he probably would have killed you and Luna So then he came upstairs sa id Harry who was watching Snape CHAPTER TWENTYNINE 620 running up the marble staircase in his minds eye his black robes billowing behind him as ever pulling his wa nd from under his cloak as he ascended and he fo und the place where you were all fighting We were in trouble we were losing said Tonks in a low voice Gibbon was down but the rest of the Death Eaters seemed ready to fight to the death Neville had been hurt Bill had been savaged by Greyback It was all dark curses flying everywhere The Malfoy boy had vanished he must have slippe d past up the stairs then more of them ran after him but one of them blocked the stair behind them with some kind of curse Neville ran at it and got thrown up into the air None of us could break through said Ron and that massive Death Eater was still firing off jinx es all over the place they were bouncing off the walls and barely missing us And then Snape was there said Tonks and then he wasnt I saw him running toward us bu t that huge Death Eaters jinx just missed me right afterward an d I ducked and lost track of things said Ginny I saw him run straight through th e cursed barrier as though it wasnt there said Lupin I trie d to follow him but was thrown back just like Neville He must have known a spell we didnt whispered McGonagall After all he was the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher I just assumed that he was in a hurry to chase after the Death Eaters whod escaped up to the tower He was said Harry savagely but to help them not to stop them and Ill bet you had to have a Dark Mark to get through that barrier so what happened when he came back down THE PHOENIX LAMENT 621 Well the big Death Eater had ju st fired off a hex that caused half the ceiling to fall in and also broke the curse blocking the stairs said Lupin We all ran forward those of us who were still standing anyway and then Snape and the boy emerged out of the dust obviously none of us attack ed them We just let them pass said Tonks in a hollow voice We thought they were being chased by the Death Eaters and next thing the other Death Eaters and Greyback were back and we were fighting again I thought I heard Snape shout something but I dont know what He shouted Its over said Harry Hed done what hed meant to do They all fell silent Fawkess lament was still echoing over the dark grounds outside As the music reverberated upon the air unbidden unwelcome thoughts slunk into Harrys mind Had they taken Dumbledores body from the foot of the tower yet What would happen to it next Wh ere would it rest He clenched his fists tightly in his pockets He could feel the small cold lump of the fake Horcrux against the knuckles of his right hand The doors of the hospital wing burst open making them all jump Mr and Mrs Weasley were st riding up the ward Fleur just behind them her beautiful face terrified Molly Arthur said Professor McGonagall jumping up and hurrying to greet them I am so sorry Bill whispered Mrs Weasley darting past Professor McGonagall as she caught sight of Bills mangled face Oh Bill Lupin and Tonks had got up hast ily and retreated so that Mr and Mrs Weasley could get nearer to the bed Mrs Weasley bent over her son and pressed her lips to his bloody forehead CHAPTER TWENTYNINE 622 You said Greyback attacked him Mr Weasley asked Professor McGonagall distractedly But he hadnt transformed So what does that mean What wi ll happen to Bill We dont yet know said Pro fessor McGonagall looking helplessly at Lupin There will probably be some contamination Arthur said Lupin It is an odd case possibly unique We dont know what his behavior might be like when he awakens Mrs Weasley took the nastysm elling ointment from Madam Pomfrey and began dabbing at Bills wounds And Dumbledore said Mr Weasley Minerva is it true Is he really As Professor McGonagall nodded Harry felt Ginny move beside him and looked at her Her slight ly narrowed eyes were fixed upon Fleur who was gazing down at Bill with a frozen expression on her face Dumbledore gone whispered Mr Weasley but Mrs Weasley had eyes only for her eldest son sh e began to sob tears falling onto Bills mutilated face Of course it doesnt matter how he looks Its not rreally important but he was a very ha ndsome little bboy always very handsome and he was ggoing to be married And what do you mean by zat said Fleur suddenly and loudly What do you mean e was going to be married Mrs Weasley raised her tearstained face looking startled Well only that You theenk Bill will not wish to marry me anymore demanded Fleur You theenk because of thes e bites he will not love me No thats not what I THE PHOENIX LAMENT 623 Because e will said Fleur draw ing herself up to her full height a n d t h r o w i n g b a c k h e r l o n g m a n e o f s i l v e r h a i r I t w o u l d t a k e more zan a werewolf to stop Bill loving me Well yes Im sure said Mr s Weasley but I thought perhaps given how how he You thought I would not weesh to marry him Or peraps you hoped said Fleur her nostrils flaring What do I care how he looks I am goodlooking enough fo r both of us I theenk All these scars show is zat my husband is brave And I shall do zat she added fiercely pushing Mrs Weas ley aside and snatching the ointment from her Mrs Weasley fell back against her husband and watched Fleur mopping up Bills wounds with a most curious expression upon her face Nobody said anything Harr y did not dare move Like everybody else he was wait ing for the explosion Our GreatAuntie Muriel said Mrs Weasley after a long pause has a very beautiful ti ara goblinmade which I am sure I could persuade her to lend you for the wedding She is very fond of Bill you know and it would look lovely with your hair Thank you said Fleur stiffly I am sure zat wi ll be lovely And then Harry did not quite see how it happened both women were crying and hugging each other Completely bewildered wondering whether the wo rld had gone mad he turned around Ron looked as stunned as he felt and Ginny and Hermione were exchanging startled looks You see said a strained voice Tonks was glaring at Lupin She still wants to marry him even th ough hes been bitten She doesnt care Its different said Lupin barely moving his lips and looking CHAPTER TWENTYNINE 624 suddenly tense Bill will not be a full werewolf The cases are completely But I dont care either I dont care said Tonks seizing the front of Lupins robes and shaking them Ive told you a million times And the meaning of Tonkss Patronus and her mousecolored hair and the reason she had co me running to find Dumbledore when she had heard a rumor someo ne had been attacked by Greyback all suddenly became clear to Harry it had not been Sirius that Tonks had fallen in love with after all And Ive told you a million times said Lu pin refusing to meet her eyes staring at the floor tha t I am too old for you too poor too dangerous Ive said all along youre taking a ridiculous line on this Remus said Mrs Weasley over Fleur s shoulder as she patted her on the back I am not being ridiculous said Lupin steadily Tonks deserves somebody young and whole But she wants you said Mr Weas ley with a small smile And after all Remus young and whole men do not necessarily remain so He gestured sadly at his son lying between them This is not the moment to di scuss it said Lupin avoiding everybodys eyes as he looked ar ound distractedly Dumbledore is dead Dumbledore would have been ha ppier than anybody to think that there was a little more love in the world said Professor McGonagall curtly just as th e hospital doors opened again and Hagrid walked in THE PHOENIX LAMENT 625 The little of his face that was no t obscured by hair or beard was soaking and swollen he was shak ing with tears a vast spotted handkerchief in his hand Ive Ive done it Professor he choked Mmoved him Professor Sprouts got the kids back in bed Professor Flitwicks lyin down but he says hell be all righ in a jiffy an Professor Slughorn says the Ministrys bin informed Thank you Hagrid said Prof essor McGonagall standing up at once and turning to look at the group around Bills bed I shall have to see the Ministry when they get here Hagrid please tell the Heads of Houses Slughorn ca n represent Slytherin that I want to see them in my office fort hwith I would like you to join us too As Hagrid nodded turned and shuffled out of the room again she looked down at Harry Befor e I meet them I would like a quick word with you Harry If youll co me with me Harry stood up murmured See you in a bit to Ron Hermione and Ginny and followed Professor Mc Gonagall back down the ward The corridors outside we re deserted and the only sound was the distant phoenix song It was several minutes before Harry became aware that they were no t heading for Professor McGonagalls office but for Dumbledores and another few seconds before he realized that of course she ha d been deputy headmistress Apparently she was now headmistre ss so the room behind the gargoyle was now hers In silence they ascended the movi ng spiral staircase and entered the circular office He did not know what he had expected that the r o o m w o u l d b e d r a p e d i n b l a c k p e r h a p s o r e v e n t h a t D u m b l e dores body might be lying there In fact it looked al most exactly as CHAPTER TWENTYNINE 626 it had done when he and Dumbledore had left it mere hours previously the silver instruments whirring and puffing on their spindlelegged tables Gryffindors sword in its glass case gleaming in the moonlight the Sorting Hat on a shelf behind the desk But Fawkess perch stood empty he was still crying his lament to the grounds And a new portrait had joined the ranks of the dead headmasters and headmistresses of Hogwarts Dumbledore was slumbering in a golden frame over th e desk his halfmoon spectacles perched upon his crooked nose looking peaceful and untroubled After glancing once at this port rait Professor McGonagall made an odd movement as th ough steeling hersel f then rounded the desk to look at Harry her face taut and lined Harry she said I would like to know what you and Professor Dumbledore were doing this evening when you left the school I cant tell you that Professor said Harry He had expected the question and had his answer ready It had been here in this very room that Dumbledore had told him that he was to confide the contents of their lessons to nobody but Ron and Hermione Harry it might be important said Professor McGonagall It is said Harry v ery but he didnt want me to tell anyone Professor McGonagall glared at him Potter Harry registered the renewed use of his surn ame in the light of Professor Dumbledores death I think you must see that the situation has changed somewhat I dont think so said Harry shrugging Professor Dumbledore never told me to stop following his or ders if he died But Theres one thing you should kn ow before the Ministry gets THE PHOENIX LAMENT 627 here though Madam Rosmertas under the Imperius Curse she was helping Malfoy and the Death Eaters thats how the necklace and the poisoned mead Rosmerta said Professor McGonagall incredulously but before she could go on there was a knock on the door behind them and Professors Sprout Flitwick and Slughorn traipsed into the room followed by Hagrid who wa s still weeping copiously his huge frame trembling with grief Snape ejaculated Slughorn wh o looked the most shaken pale and sweating Snape I taught him I thought I knew him But before any of them could respond to this a sharp voice spoke from high on the wall A sa llowfaced wizard with a short black fringe had just walked back into his empty canvas Minerva the Minister will be he re within seconds he has just Disapparated from the Ministry Thank you Everard said Professor McGonagall and she turned quickly to her teachers I want to talk about what happ ens to Hogwarts before he gets here she said quickly Personally I am not convinced that the school should reopen next year The death of the headmaster at the hands of one of our colleagues is a terrible stain upon Hogwartss history It is horrible I a m s u r e D u m b l e d o r e w o u l d h a v e w a n t e d t h e s c h o o l t o r e main open said Professor Sprout I feel that if a single pupil wants to come then the school ought to remain open for that pupil But will we have a single pupil after this said Slughorn now dabbing his sweating brow with a si lken handkerchief Parents will CHAPTER TWENTYNINE 628 want to keep their children at ho me and I cant sa y I blame them Personally I dont think were in mo re danger at Hogwarts than we are anywhere else but you cant expect mothers to think like that Theyll want to keep their families together its only natural I agree said Professor McGonaga ll And in any case it is not true to say that Dumbledore never envisaged a situation in which Hogwarts might close When the Chamber of Secrets reopened he considered the closure of the sc hool and I must say that Professor Dumbledores murder is more distur bing to me than the idea of Slytherins monster living undetected in the bowels of the castle We must consult the governors said Professor Flitwick in his squeaky little voice he had a la rge bruise on his forehead but seemed otherwise unscathed by his collapse in Snapes office We must follow the established procedures A decision should not be made hastily Hagrid you havent said anything said Professor McGonagall What are your views ought Hogwarts to remain open Hagrid who had been weeping silently into his large spotted handkerchief throughout this conv ersation now raised puffy red eyes and croaked I dunno Profe ssor thats fer the Heads of House an the headmistre ss ter decide Professor Dumbledore always valu ed your views said Professor McGonagall kind ly and so do I Well Im stayin said Hagrid fat tears still leaking out of the corners of his eyes and trickling down into his tangled beard Its me home its bin me home sinc e I was thirteen An if theres kids who wan me ter teach em I ll do it But I dunno THE PHOENIX LAMENT 629 Hogwarts without Dumbledore He gulped and disappeared behind his handkerchief once mo re and there was silence Very well said Professor McGonagall glancing out of the window at the grounds checking to see whether the Minister was yet approaching then I must agree with Filius that the right thing to do is to consult the go vernors who wi ll make the fi nal decision Now as to getting students home there is an argument for doing it sooner rather than late r We could arrange for the Hogwarts Express to come to morrow if necessary What about Dumbledores funera l said Harry speaking at last Well said Professor McGo nagall losing a little of her briskness as her voice shook I I know that it was Dumbledores wish to be laid to rest here at Hogwarts Then thats whatll happen is nt it said Harry fiercely If the Ministry thinks it appropriate said Professor McGonagall No other headmaster or headmistress has ever been No other headmaster or headmist ress ever gave more to this school growled Hagrid Hogwarts should be Dumbledore s final resting place said Professor Flitwick Absolutely said Professor Sprout And in that case said Harry you shouldnt send the students home until the funerals over Theyll want to say The last word caught in his throat but Professor Sprout completed the sentence for him Goodbye Well said squeaked Professor Fl itwick Well said indeed Our CHAPTER TWENTYNINE 630 students should pay tribute it is fitting We can arrange transport home afterward Seconded barked Professor Sprout I suppose yes said Slughorn in a rather agitated voice while Hagrid let out a st rangled sob of assent Hes coming said Professor McGonagall suddenly gazing down into the grounds The Minist er and by the looks of it hes brought a de legation Can I leave Professor said Harry at once He had no desire at all to see or be interrogated by Rufus Scrimgeour tonight You may said Professor McGonagall And quickly She strode toward the door and he ld it open for him He sped down the spiral staircase and off along the deserted corridor he had left his Invisibility Cloak at the top of the Astronomy Tower but it did not matter there was nobody in the corridors to see him pass not even Filch Mrs Norris or Peeves He did not meet another soul until he turned into the passage leadin g to the Gryffindor common room Is it true whispered the Fat Lady as he approached her It is really true Dumb ledore dead Yes said Harry She let out a wail and without waiting for the password swung forward to admit him As Harry had suspec ted it would be th e common room was jampacked The room fell silent as he climbed through the portrait hole He saw Dean and Seamus sitting in a group nearby This meant that the dormitory must be empty or nearly so Without THE PHOENIX LAMENT 631 speaking to anybody without maki ng eye contact at all Harry walked straight across the room and through the door to the boys dormitories As he had hoped Ron was waiting for him still fully dressed sitting on his bed Harry sat down on his own fourposter and for a moment they simply stared at each other Theyre talking about closin g the school said Harry Lupin said they would said Ron There was a pause So said Ron in a very low voice as though he thought the furniture might be listening in Did you find one Did you get it A a Horcrux Harry shook his head All that had taken place around that black lake seemed like an old nightmar e now had it really happened and only hours ago You didnt get it said Ron looking crestfallen It wasnt there No said Harry Someone had alre ady taken it and left a fake in its place Already taken Wordlessly Harry pulled the fake locket from his pocket opened it and passed it to Ron The full sto ry could wait It did not matter tonight nothing mattered except the end the end of their pointless adventure the end of Dumble dores life RAB whispered Ron but who was that Dunno said Harry lying back on his bed fully clothed and staring blankly upwards He felt no curiosity at all about RAB He doubted that he would ever feel curious again As he lay there CHAPTER TWENTYNINE 632 he became aware suddenly that the grounds were silent Fawkes had stopped singing And he knew without knowing how he knew it that the phoenix had gone had left Hogwar ts for good just as Dumbledore had left the school had left th e world ha d left Harry T H I R T Y 633 THE WHITE TOMB ll lessons were suspended all examinations postponed Some students were hurried away from Hogwarts by their parents over the next couple of days the Patil twins were gone before breakfast on the morning following Dumbledores death and Zacharias Smith was escorted from the castle by his haughtylooking father Seamus Fi nnigan on the other hand refused pointblank to accompany his mother home they had a shouting match in the entrance hall that was resolved when she agreed that he could remain behind for the funeral She had difficulty in finding a bed in Hogsmead e Seamus told Harry and Ron for wizards and witches were pourin g into the village preparing to pay their last respec ts to Dumbledore Some excitement was caused am ong the younger students who had never seen it before when a po wderblue carriage the size of a house pulled by a dozen giant wing ed palominos came soaring out of the sky in the late afternoon before the funeral and landed on the A CHAPTER THIRTY 634 edge of the forest Harry watched from a window as a gigantic and handsome oliveskinned black haired woman descended the carriage steps and threw herself into the waiting Hagrids arms Meanwhile a delegation of Ministry offi cials including the Minister of Magic himself was being accomm odated within the castle Harry was diligently avoiding contact with any of them he was sure that sooner or later he would be as ked again to account for Dumbledores last excursion from Hogwarts Harry Ron Hermione and Ginny were spending all of their time together The beautiful weat her seemed to mock them Harry could imagine how it would have been if Dumbledore had not died and they had had this time together at the very end of the year Ginnys examinations finish ed the pressure of homework lifted and hour by hour he put off saying the thing that he knew he must say doing what he knew was right to do because it was too hard to forgo his best source of comfort They visited the hospital wing twice a day Neville had been discharged but Bill remained unde r Madam Pomfreys care His scars were as bad as ever in truth he now bore a dist inct resemblance to MadEye Moody though thankfully with both eyes and legs but in personality he seemed just the same as ever All that appeared to have changed was that he now had a great liking for very rare steaks so eet ees lucky e is marrying me said Fleur happily plumping up Bills pillows because ze British overcook their meat I ave always said this I suppose Im just going to have to accept that he really is going to marry her sighed Gi nny later that evening as she Harry Ron THE WHITE TOMB 635 and Hermione sat beside the open window of the Gryffindor common room looking out over the twilit grounds Shes not that bad said Harry Ugly though he added hastily as Ginny raised her eyebrows and she let out a reluctant giggle Well I suppose if Mum can stand it I can Anyone else we know died Ron asked Hermione who was perusing the Evening Prophet Hermione winced at the forced toughness in his voice No she said reprovingly folding up the newspaper Theyre still looking for Snape but no sign Of course there isnt said Ha rry who became angry every time this subject cropped up They wo nt find Snape till they find Voldemort and seeing as theyve never managed to do that in all this time Im going to go to bed yaw ned Ginny I havent been sleeping that well since well I could do with some sleep She kissed Harry Ron looked aw ay pointedly waved at the other two and departed for the gi rls dormitories The moment the door had closed behind her He rmione leaned forward toward Harry with a most Hermione ish look on her face Harry I found something out th is morning in the library RAB said Harry sitting up straight He did not feel the way he had so often felt before excited curious burning to get to the bottom of a mystery he simply knew that the task of discovering the tr uth about the real Horcrux had to be completed before he could move a little farther along the dark and winding path stretching ahead of him the path that he and CHAPTER THIRTY 636 Dumbledore had set out upon together and which he now knew he would have to journey alone There might still be as many as four Horcruxes out there somewher e and each would need to be found and eliminated before there was even a possibili ty that Voldemort could be killed He kept re citing their names to himself as though by listing them he co uld bring them within reach the locket the cup the snake something of Gryffindors or Ravenclaws the locket the cup the snake something of Gryffindors or Ravenclaws This mantra seemed to pulse th rough Harrys mind as he fell asleep at night and his dreams were thick with cups lockets and mysterious objects that he could not quite reach though Dumbledore helpfully offered Harry a rope la dder that turned to snakes the moment he began to climb He had shown Hermione the note inside the locket the morning after Dumbledores death and al though she had not immediately recognized the initials as belong ing to some obscure wizard about whom she had been reading she ha d since been rushing off to the library a little more often than wa s strictly necessary for somebody who had no homework to do No she said sadly Ive be en trying Harry but I havent found anything There are a couple of reasonably wellknown wizards with those initials Rosalind Antigone Bungs Rupert Axebanger Brookstanton but th ey dont seem to fit at all Judging by that note the pers on who stole the Horcrux knew Voldemort and I cant find a shre d of evidence that Bungs or Axebanger ever had anything to do wi th him No actually its about well Snape She looked nervous even saying the name again THE WHITE TOMB 637 What about him asked Harry heav ily slumping back in his chair Well its just that I was so rt of right about the HalfBlood Prince business she said tentatively Dyou have to rub it in He rmione How dyou think I feel about that now No no Harry I didnt mean that she said hastily looking around to check that they were not being overheard Its just that I was right about Eileen Prince once owning the book You see she was Snapes mother I thought she wasnt much of a looker said Ron Hermione ignored him I was going through the rest of the old Prophets and there was a tiny announcement about Eileen Prince marrying a man called Tobias Snape and then later an announcement saying that shed given birth to a murderer spat Harry Well yes said Hermione So I was sort of right Snape must have been proud of being half a Prince you see Tobias Snape was a Muggle fr om what it said in the Prophet Yeah that fits said Harry H ed play up the pureblood side so he could get in with Lucius Ma lfoy and the rest of them Hes just like Voldemort Pureb lood mother Muggle father ashamed of his parentage trying to make himself feared using the Dark Arts gave himself an impressive new name Lord Voldemort the HalfBlood Prince how could Dumbledore have missed He broke off looking out the window He could not stop himself dwelling upon Dumbledores inexcusable trust in Snape CHAPTER THIRTY 638 but as Hermione had just inadvertently reminded him he Harry had been taken in just the same In spite of the increasing nastiness of those scribbled spells he had refused to believe ill of the boy who had been so clever who had helped him so much Helped him it was an almost unendurable thought now I still dont get why he didnt tu rn you in for using that book said Ron He mustve known where you were getting it all from He knew said Harry bitterly He knew when I used Sectumsempra He didnt really need Legi limency He might even have known before then with Slughorn talking about how brilliant I was at Potions Shouldnt have left his old book in the bottom of that cupboard should he But why didnt he turn you in I dont think he wanted to asso ciate himself with that book said Hermione I dont think Dumbledore would have liked it very much if hed known And even if Snape pretended it hadnt been his Slughorn would have re cognized his writing at once Anyway the book was left in Sn apes old classroom and Ill bet Dumbledore knew his mother was called Prince I shouldve shown the book to Dumbledore said Harry All that time he was show ing me how Voldemort was evil even when he was at school and I ha d proof Snape was too Evil is a strong word said Hermione quietly You were the one who kept telling me the book was dangerous Im trying to say Ha rry that youre putt ing too much blame on yourself I thought the Prince seem ed to have a nasty sense of humor but I would never have guessed he was a potential killer THE WHITE TOMB 639 None of us couldve guessed Sn ape would you know said Ron Silence fell between them each of them lost in their own thoughts but Harry was sure that they like him were thinking about the following morning when Dumbledores body would be laid to rest He had never attended a funeral before there had been no body to bury when Sirius had di ed He did not know what to expect and was a little worried about what he might see about how he would feel He wondered whether Dumbledores death would be more real to him once it was over Though he had moments when the horrible fact of it threatened to overwhelm him there were blank stretches of numbness where despite the fact that nobody was talking about anything else in the whole castle he still found it difficult to believe that Dumbledor e had really gone Admittedly he had not as he had with Sirius lo oked desperately for some kind of loophole some way that Dumble dore would come back He felt in his pocket for the cold chai n of the fake Horcrux which he now carried with him everywhere not as a talisman but as a reminder of what it had cost an d what remained still to do Harry rose early to pack the ne xt day the Hogwarts Express would be leaving an hour after the funeral Downstairs he found the mood in the Great Hall subdue d Everybody was wearing their dress robes and no one seemed ve ry hungry Professor McGonagall had left the thronelike chair in the middle of the staff table empty Hagrids chair was deserted too Harry thought that perhaps he had not been able to face breakfast but Snapes place had been unceremoniously filled by Rufus Scrimge our Harry avoided his yellowish eyes as they scanned the Hall Ha rry had the uncomfortable feeling CHAPTER THIRTY 640 that Scrimgeour was looking fo r him Among Scrimgeours entourage Harry spotted the red hair and hornrimmed glasses of Percy Weasley Ron gave no sign that he was aware of Percy apart from stabbing pieces of kipper with unwonted venom Over at the Slytherin table Cr abbe and Goyle were muttering together Hulking boys though they were they looked oddly lonely without the tall pale figure of Malfoy between them bossing them around Harry had not spared Malf oy much thought His animosity was all for Snape but he had not forgotten the fear in Malfoys voice on that tower top nor the fa ct that he had lowered his wand before the other Death Eaters arrived Harry did not believe that Malfoy would have killed Dumble dore He despised Malfoy still for his infatuation with the Dark Arts but now the tiniest drop of pity mingled with his dislike Where Harry wondered was Malfoy now and what was Voldemort ma king him do under threat of killing him and his parents Harrys thoughts were interrupted by a nudge in the ribs from Ginny Professor McGonagall had ri sen to her feet and the mournful hum in the Hall died away at once It is nearly time she said Ple ase follow your Heads of Houses out into the grounds G ryffindors after me They filed out from behind thei r benches in near silence Harry glimpsed Slughorn at the head of the Slytherin column wearing magnificent long emerald green robes embroidered with silver He had never seen Professor Sprout Head of the Hufflepuffs looking so clean there was not a single patch on her hat and when they reached the entrance hall they found Madam Pince standing beside Filch she in a thick black veil that fell to her knees he in an ancient black suit and ti e reeking of mothballs THE WHITE TOMB 641 They were heading as Harry sa w when he stepped out onto the stone steps from the front doors toward the lake The warmth of the sun caressed his face as they followed Professor McGonagall in silence to the place where hundreds of chairs had been set out in rows An aisle ran down the center of them There was a marble table standing at the front all chai rs facing it It was the most beautiful summers day An extraordinary assortment of people had already settled into half of the chairs shabby and sm art old and young Most Harry did not recognize but a few he di d including members of the Order of the Phoenix Kingsley Sh acklebolt MadEye Moody Tonks her hair miraculously returned to vividest pink Remus Lupin with whom she seemed to be holding hands Mr and Mrs Weasley Bill supported by Fleur and followed by Fred and George who were wearing jackets of bl ack dragon skin Then there was Madame Maxime who took up two and a half chairs on her own Tom the landlord of the Leaky Cauldron in Lo ndon Arabella Figg Harrys Squib neighbor the hairy bass player from the Wizarding group the Weird Sisters Ernie Prang driver of the Knight Bus Madam Malkin of the robe sh op in Diagon Alley and some people whom Harry merely knew by sight such as the barman of the Hogs Head and the witch who pushed the trolley on the Hogwarts Express The castle ghosts were there too barely visible in the bright sunlight discernible only when they moved shimmering insubstantially on the gleaming air Harry Ron Hermione and Ginny fi led into seats at the end of a r o w b e s i d e t h e l a k e P e o p l e w e r e w h i s p e r i n g t o e a c h o t h e r i t sounded like a breeze in the grass but the birdsong was louder by far The crowd continue d to swell with a great rush of affection CHAPTER THIRTY 642 for both of them Harry saw Neville being helped into a seat by Luna Neville and Luna alone of the DA had responded to Hermiones summons the night that Dumbledore had died and Harry knew why They were the ones wh o had missed the DA most probably the ones who had checke d their coins regularly in the hope that there would be another meeting Cornelius Fudge walked past toward the front rows his expression miserable twirling his green bowler hat as usual Harry next recognized Rita Skeeter who he was infuriated to see had a notebook clutched in her redtaloned hand and then with a worse jolt of fury Dolores Umbridge an un convincing expression of grief upon her toadlike face a black velv et bow set atop her ironcolored curls At the sight of the centaur Firenze wh o was standing like a sentinel near the waters edge she gave a start and scurried hastily into a seat a g ood distance away The staff was seated at last Ha rry could see Scrimgeour looking grave and dignified in the front row with Professor McGonagall He wondered whether Scrimgeour or any of these important people were really sorry that Dumbledo re was dead But then he heard music strange otherworldly music and he forgot his dislike of the M i n i s t r y i n l o o k i n g a r o u n d f o r t h e s o u r c e o f i t H e w a s n o t t h e only one Many heads were turning searching a little alarmed In there whispered Gi nny in Harrys ear And he saw them in the clear gree n sunlit water inches below the surface reminding him horribly of the Inferi a chorus of merpeople singing in a strange langua ge he did not understand their pallid faces rippling their purpli sh hair flowing all around them The music made the hair on Harrys neck stand up and yet it was not unpleasant It spoke very clearl y of loss and of despair As he THE WHITE TOMB 643 looked down into the wild faces of the singers he had the feeling that they at least were sorry for Dumbledores passing Then Ginny nudged him again and he looked around Hagrid was walking slowly up the aisle between the chairs He was crying quite silently his face gleaming with tears and in his a r m s w r a p p e d i n p u r p l e v e l v e t s p a n g l e d w i t h g o l d e n s t a r s w a s what Harry knew to be Dumbledor es body A sharp pain rose in Harrys throat at this sight Fo r a moment the strange music and the knowledge that Dumbledores body was so close seemed to take all warmth from the day Ron looked white and shocked Tears were falling thick and fast into both Ginnys and Hermiones laps They could not see clearly what was happening at the front Hagrid seemed to have placed the b ody carefully upon the table Now he retreated down the aisle blowin g his nose with loud trumpeting noises that drew scandalized lo oks from some including Harry saw Dolores Umbridge but Harry knew that Dumbledore would not have cared He tried to make a fr iendly gesture to Hagrid as he passed but Hagrids eyes were so swollen it was a wonder he could see where he was going Harry glanced at the back row to which Hagrid was heading and real ized what was guiding him for there dressed in a jacket and trousers each the size of a small marquee was the giant Grawp his grea t ugly boulderlike head bowed docile almost human Hagrid sa t down next to his halfbrother and Grawp patted Hagrid hard on th e head so that his chair legs sank into the ground Harry had a wonderful momentary urge to laugh But then the music stopped and he turned to face the front again A little tuftyhaired man in plai n black robes had got to his feet and stood now in front of Dumb ledores body Harry could not CHAPTER THIRTY 644 hear what he was saying Odd word s floated back to them over the hundreds of heads Nobility of sp irit intellectual contribution greatness of heart It did not mean very much It had little to do with Dumbledore as Harry had known him He suddenly remembered Dumbledores id ea of a few words nitwit oddment blubber and tweak and again had to suppress a grin What was the matter with him There was a soft splashing noise to his left and he saw that the merpeople had broken the surface to listen too He remembered Dumbledore crouching at the water s edge two years ago very close to where Harry now sat and conver sing in Mermish with the Merchieftainess Harry wondered where Dumbledore had learned Mermish There was so much he ha d never asked him so much he should have said And then without warning it swept over him the dreadful truth more completely and undeniably than it had until now Dumbledore was dead gone He clutched the cold locket in his hand so tightly that it hurt but he could not prevent hot tears spilling from his eyes He looked away from Ginny and the others and stared out over the lake toward the forest as the little man in black droned on There wa s movement among the trees The centaurs had come to pay their re spects too They did not move into the open but Harry saw them st anding quite still half hidden in shadow watching the wizards th eir bows hanging at their sides And Harry remembered his first nightmarish trip into the forest the first time he had ever encountered the thing that was then Voldemort and how he had faced him and how he and Dumbledore had discussed fighting a losing battle not long thereafter It THE WHITE TOMB 645 was important Dumbledore said to fight and fight again and keep fighting for only then could evil be kept at bay though never quite eradicated And Harry saw very clearly as he sat there under the hot sun how people who cared about him had stood in front of him one by one his mother his father his godfather and finally Dumbledore all determined to protect him but now that was over He could not let anybody else stand between him an d Voldemort he must abandon forever the illusion he ought to have lost at the age of one that the shelter of a parents arms mean t that nothing could hurt him There was no waking from his ni ghtmare no comforting whisper in the dark that he was safe really that it was all in his imagination the last and greatest of his prot ectors had died and he was more alone than he had ever been before The little man in black had stop ped speaking at last and resumed his seat Harry waited for some body else to get to their feet he expected speeches probably from the Minister but nobody moved Then several people screamed Br ight white flames had erupted around Dumbledores body and the table upon which it lay Higher and higher they rose ob scuring the body White smoke spiraled into the air and made strange shapes Harry thought for one heartstopping moment that he saw a phoenix fly joyfully into the blue but next second the fire had vanished In its place was a white marble tomb encasing Dumb ledores body and the table on which he had rested There were a few more cries of shock as a shower of arrows soared through the air but they fell far short of the crowd It was CHAPTER THIRTY 646 Harry knew the centaurs tribute He saw them turn tail and disappear back into the cool trees Likewise the merpeople sank slowly back into the green wa ter and were lost from view Harry looked at Ginny Ron and Hermione Rons face was screwed up as though the sunlight were blinding him Hermiones face was glazed with tears but Ginny was no longer crying She met Harrys gaze with the same hard blazing look that he had seen when she had hugged him after wi nning the Quidditch Cup in his absence and he knew that at th at moment they understood each other perfectly and that when he told her what he was going to do now she would not say Be carefu l or Dont do it but accept his decision because she would not have expected anything less of him And so he steeled himself to say what he had known he must say ever since Dumbledore had died Ginny listen he said very quietly as the buzz of conversation grew louder around them and people began to get to their feet I cant be involved with you an ymore Weve got to stop seeing each other We ca nt be together She said with an oddly twisted sm ile Its for some stupid noble reason isnt it Its been like like something out of someone elses life these last few weeks with you said Harry But I cant we cant Ive got things to do alone now She did not cry she simply looked at him Voldemort uses people his enemies are close to Hes already used you as bait once and that was just because youre my best friends sister Think how much danger youll be in if we keep this up Hell know hell find out Hell try and get to me through you What if I dont care said Ginny fiercely THE WHITE TOMB 647 I care said Harry How do you think Id feel if this was your funeral and it wa s my fault She looked away from him over the lake I never really gave up on you she said Not really I always hoped Hermione told me to get on with life maybe go out with some other people relax a bit around you because I never used to be able to talk if you were in the room remember And she thought you might take a bit more notice if I was a bit more myself Smart girl that Hermione said Harry trying to smile I just wish Id asked you sooner We coul dve had ages months years maybe But youve been too busy saving the Wizarding world said Ginny half laughing Well I cant say Im surprised I knew this would happen in the end I knew you wo uldnt be happy unless you were hunting Voldemort Maybe thats why I like you so much Harry could not bear to hear thes e things nor did he think his resolution would hold if he remai ned sitting beside her Ron he saw was now holding Hermione and stroking her hair while she sobbed into his shoulder tears dr ipping from the end of his own long nose With a miserable gesture Harry got up turned his back on Ginny and on Dumbledores tomb and walked away around the lake Moving felt much more bearable than sitting still just as setting out as soon as possible to track down the Horcruxes and kill Voldemort would feel better than waitin g to do it Harry He turned Rufus Scrimgeour wa s limping rapidly toward him around the bank leaning on his walking stick CHAPTER THIRTY 648 Ive been hoping to ha ve a word do you mind if I walk a little way with you No said Harry indifferen tly and set off again Harry this was a dreadful tragedy said Scrimgeour quietly I cannot tell you how ap palled I was to hear of it Dumbledore was a very great wizard We had our disagreements as you know but no one knows better than I What do you want asked Harry flatly Scrimgeour looked annoyed but as before hastily modified his expression to one of so rrowful understanding You are of course devastated he said I know that you were very close to Dumbledore I think you may have been his favorite pupil ever The bond between the two of you What do you want Harry re peated coming to a halt Scrimgeour stopped too leaned on his stick and stared at Harry his expression shrewd now The word is that you were with him when he left the school the night that he died Whose word said Harry Somebody Stupefied a Death Eate r on top of the tower after Dumbledore died There were also two broomsticks up there The Ministry can add two and two Harry Glad to hear it said Harry Well where I went with Dumbledore and what we did is my busi ness He didnt want people to know Such loyalty is admirable of course said Scrimgeour who seemed to be restraining his irri tation with diffi culty but Dumbledore is gone Ha rry Hes gone THE WHITE TOMB 649 He will only be gone from th e school when none here are loyal to him said Harry smil ing in spite of himself My dear boy even Dumbledo re cannot return from the I am not saying he can You wouldnt understand But Ive got nothing to tell you Scrimgeour hesitated then said in what was evidently supposed to be a tone of delicacy The Ministry can offer you all sorts of protection you know Harry I wo uld be delighted to place a couple of my Aurors at your service Harry laughed Voldemort wants to kill me himself and Aurors wont stop him So thanks fo r the offer but no thanks So said Scrimgeour his voice cold now the request I made of you at Christmas What request Oh yeah the one where I tell the world what a great job youre doing in exchange for for raising eve ryones morale snapped Scrimgeour Harry considered him for a moment Released Stan Shunpike yet Scrimgeour turned a nasty purple color highly reminiscent of Uncle Vernon I see you are Dumbledores man through and through said Harry Thats right Scrimgeour glared at him for another moment then turned and limped away without another word Harry could see Percy and the rest of the Ministry delegation waiting for him casting nervous glances at the sobbing Hagrid and Grawp who were still in their seats Ron and Hermione were hu rrying toward Harry passing CHAPTER THIRTY 650 Scrimgeour going in the opposi te direction Harry turned and walked slowly on waiting for them to catch up which they finally did in the shade of a beech tree under which they had sat in happier times What did Scrimgeour want Hermione whispered Same as he wanted at Christ mas shrugged Harry Wanted me to give him inside inform ation on Dumbledore and be the Ministrys new poster boy Ron seemed to struggle with him self for a moment then he said loudly to Hermione Look let me go back and hit Percy No she said firmly grabbing his arm Itll make me feel better Harry laughed Even Hermione grinned a little though her smile faded as she looked up at the castle I cant bear the idea that we might never come back she said softly How can Hogwarts close Maybe it wont said Ron We re not in any more danger here than we are at home are we Everywheres the same now Id even say Hogwarts is safer there are more wizards inside to defend the place What dyou reckon Harry Im not coming back even if it does reopen said Harry Ron gaped at him but Hermione sa id sadly I knew you were going to say that But th en what will you do Im going back to the Dursleys once more because Dumbledore wanted me to said Harry But itll be a short visit and then Ill be gone for good But where will you go if you dont come back to school I thought I might go back to Godrics Hollow Harry muttered He had had the idea in hi s head ever since the night of THE WHITE TOMB 651 Dumbledores death For me it started there all of it Ive just got a feeling I need to go there And I can visit my parents graves Id like that And then what said Ron Then Ive got to track down the rest of the Horcruxes havent I said Harry his eyes upon Du mbledores white tomb reflected in the water on the other side of the lake Thats what he wanted me to do thats why he told me all about them If Dumbledore was right and Im sure he was there are still four of them out there Ive got to find them and destroy them and then Ive got to go after the seventh bit of Voldemort s soul the bit thats still in his body and Im the one whos going to kill him And if I meet Severus Snape along the way he added so much the better for me so much the worse for him There was a long silence The cr owd had almost dispersed now the stragglers giving the monumental figure of Grawp a wide berth as he cuddled Hagrid whose howls of grief were still echoing across the water Well be there Harry said Ron What At your aunt and uncles house said Ron And then well go with you wherever youre going No said Harry quickly he ha d not counted on this he had meant them to understand that he was undertaking this most dangerous journey alone You said to us once before sa id Hermione quietly that there was time to turn back if we wanted to Weve had time havent we Were with you whatever happens said Ron But mate youre CHAPTER THIRTY 652 going to have to come round my mum and dads house before we do anything else even Godrics Hollow Why Bill and Fleurs we dding remember Harry looked at him startled the idea that anything as normal as a wedding could still exist seem ed incredible and yet wonderful Yeah we shouldnt miss that he said finally His hand closed automatically ar ound the fake Horcrux but in spite of everything in spite of th e dark and twisting path he saw stretching ahead for himself in spite of the final meeting with Voldemort he knew must come whet her in a month in a year or in ten he felt his heart lift at the thought that
